Gamestop Friday Notes - Short Sellers will loose 🚀🚀🚀,78,ky5vsz,,564,1610750713,"&amp;#x200B;

Today has been an incredible day for us despite the 11% share price drop. I want to use this opportunity to thank everyone for holding their line. Many of us, including myself, have bought more shares today and will continue to do so until we see the actual squeeze happening.

  

### 📅 This has happened today:

* GME board members who are resigning have sold their shares causing today's price drop (NEGATIVE but the market came together and held the line to minimize impact)
* Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin on $GME (POSITIVE)
* There is current talk about margin calls going out soon (POSITIVE)
* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday (POSITIVE)  


### 🔮 This will happen soon:

* Short sellers will be margin called soon - there is no way around this now
* **We will have another large squeeze**
* GameStop will undergo a huge transformation and capitalize on the ever-growing esports / video game market

&amp;#x200B;

### 🐻 Melvin and other short sellers

You targeted the wrong firm! You were gambling on 45,000+ people (FT &amp; PT) to loose their jobs as GameStop would slowly go out of business. 

But guess what: after Ryan Cohen bought further into GME this will never happen. The team at RC Ventures will make sure of that. And us, we will hold the line and buy further into it until we get rid of all large short positions. GME is not a dead company, it is just getting started.

**GameStop is here to stay and will undergo an amazing transformation!**

&amp;#x200B;

Note: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have no impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence.

PS:  🚀🚀🚀🚀

Positions: 190 shares, 5 1/22 $38c (full reinvestment of my old calls)

TL;DR: Today was a rough day but an amazing setup for the coming week. $GME will go to the moon.",2021-01-15 17:45:13

SEC filings today showed that GME insiders are selling stock. The absence of a filing from any Cohen/related may be more telling of what the future has to hold than the sales we know about,28,ky5uyk,,76,1610750640,"I'll keep it short

* Board members that are likely on their way out are selling shares
* An additional board member's (Kurt Wolf's)  fund sold a bunch of shares the other day to align with their concentration guidelines for individual stock positions. Essentially the price went up too much and the position got too big as a percent of total assets so they sold some.
* Per the recent agreement Ryan Cohen signed with the company he is not allowed to own more than a 19.9% steak. As of the most recent filing he only owns 12.9%
* Form 4 (change in ownership over 10%) must be filed within 2 business days (Ryan Cohen subject to this one)
* Forms 13-D (ownership over 5% &amp; insiders) &amp; Form 3 (new steaks over 10%) must be filed within 10 days (New board members subject to these)

The Important Part:

Because we didn't have a Form 4 filed today by Ryan Cohen the massive move Wednesday was not fueled by him picking up an additional 7%. This means he likely still has dry powder to buy more stock if he wants it. Additionally no forms 13-D or 3 means that the new directors may not have picked up shares yet either (if they want them). Additional share buying from RC/Friends could help send this to the moon   🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀

\- 155% growth in points of distribution, with projections to grow to over 200% in 2021. (They are looking to expand beyond the US market)

\- Vertically integrated operations reduce costs massively and impact margin positively.

\- E-commerce side of the business has started to operate recently.

\- Under 8% of shares are held by institutions (when this gets covered more we should see share price shoot up).

\- Company hasn't really spent anything on advertising yet and is pulling in huge numbers. They are planning on going all out on advertising in 2021.",2021-01-15 17:37:15

"#BB Gang, who of you holded the line today and did not run from the battlefield?",45,ky5jhs,,414,1610749664,"Today was a crazy day.  The whole market is down, nothing makes any sense and all the paper hands probably abandoned the ship before the long weekend.

I am still mad, despite being in profit cuz I have no fucking idea how it is possible for a stock to drop 20 percent after open without crushing negative news. I have never seen something like this. However, there is no room for panic. Apple is expected to have historic earnings in less than 2 weeks and the stock experienced a huge dip today, GME fell hard also and every fucking autist here was buying it. We finished the day at 8 percent up.

I would not judge anyone who sales next week, not everyone needs to be a long term investor, but fuck the paper handed mfos who bought shares today and immediatly sold 1 hour later. How much can you actually lose? The absolute bottom is 4 per share and that would put the company at 2.5 bil valuation. The brand name is worth more than that and BB is a significant player in the IoT, Cybersecurity and EV industries. The cyber firm Crowdstrike has  180 mil revenue compared to BB near 1 billion and is valued at 50 billion, ten times more than BB. If you are gonna paper hand, at least wait till you are an in profit, the retards  who sold GME after the last dip are deeply regretting it now.

Here is what that means,4,kyt77m,,66,1610836899,"So much fomo happening on this sub a lot of these questions seem to pop up by uneducated traders that don't want to miss out. Hopefully this will make sense and give you a more accurate view of what is happening with so many shorts in this market

Keep in mind I am going to try and keep it simple, so there might be some inaccuracies but the general idea is the same.

Let's say a stocks float is 100MM shares

If the short interest is 150MM shares, that would be a short interest of 150%

A lot of people seem confused about where those extra 50MM shares would come from. What happens when a stock is sold short is it creates a ""synthetic"" stock for the buyer. The stock is still a real stock, but it was effectively created through the shorting process.

So a good way to see how many actual shares exist, you add the float and short interest together. Essentially, you add the synthetic shares to the float.

In this case, that would be 250MM shares

So once forced to cover, the shorts would be forced to purchase 150MM of the available 250MM shares.

The example I used above is a purely hypothetical example and in no way related to any current equity or stock ticker. All information here is only for educational purposes and is not a recommendation or advice.

"$FUBO DD - Connecting the dots, this thing is going to be a MONSTER.",6,kyt46m,,124,1610836628,"Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.

First, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. 

Q3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)

* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  

   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.
   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.
* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.
* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.
* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.

Q4 Preliminary Results:

[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)

* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.
* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.

It smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. 

*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021

&amp;#x200B;

Most of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. 

As mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:

\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.

\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)

\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)

Fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, on to the NBA:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)

""Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&amp;A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV’s formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world – Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.""

David Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.

Why am I bringing up the NBA?

[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)

People are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. 

The NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, lets look into two key acquisitions: 

\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. 

Balto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.

&amp;#x200B;

Fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)

34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. 

Since the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. 

Short term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.

Long term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute.",2021-01-16 17:37:08

Changing RH from a Margin (Default) to a Cash Account.,5,kyt3sh,,47,1610836591,"I'm seeing a lot of retards here that think because they've disabled lending, or because they aren't borrowing money, that they're shares won't be lent out. That's not the case. Even if you aren't borrowing money, it's still a margin account if you can use instant deposit or have never heard of ""settlements.""

Margin (the type of account) and margin (the money they lend you) are different. ..ish.

Margin accounts let you spend your money immediately after closing a trade, where as cash accounts need you to wait 1 day for options or 2 for stock. RH lets you trade immediately even when under 2000 and not in an official margin account, by personally lending you the money. Instant deposits are the same. They can only lend the money if you're on what is typically called, a margin account.

Luckily for you there's still time to fix it and switch to cash:

You can downgrade to a traditional Robinhood cash account by emailing support@robinhood.com with the following:

- Confirmation that you have $0.00 in unsettled funds and no pending transactions. You can view your unsettled funds in the Account section and your pending transactions in the History section of the account menu.

- Your feedback on why you no longer want to use Robinhood Instant.

*Once we have your email, we should be able to downgrade your account within a few business days.*

**TL;DR:** Increase your tendies by emailing support@robinhood.com the following as soon as possible because it takes a few days to go through. The lazy shits can't even properly take our money.

The end of retail trading *Discussion*,0,kysrl4,,40,1610835510,"I am concerned that there will be a wave of “anti-wall street” bills and regulations passed by Biden. It will be in the name of income inequality, etc. However, it will really just screw the retail investors like ourselves. Wall Street was fine sucking money from retail when they were individuals, but now that there are untied factions (such as WSB) I think they view us as dangerous. 

I have heard other people that the GME play was the final nail in the coffin, and that we are in their sights now. I expect WSB to get shut down for insider trading, but what are the other ways they could screw retail? Thinking: 1. No retail trading for accounts under 25K 2. Raise day trading limits to like 100K or 500K or even worse, need a license. 3. Tax the shit out of cap gains in a way that the big banks will be able to loophole their ways out of. Like tax gains at 80% unless the trader had underlying shares in the stock. I don’t know, I’m just spitballing. I want to get defensive with my plays so that I am not left out in the wind when it happens. 

What do you think?

*Edit* holy shit I don’t think there was insider trading - I’m saying they will use that as the reason to shut us down. Look at the 25K PTD limit. Hope you cocky bastards are right.",2021-01-16 17:18:30

TLDR; GET TO THE CHOPPA! eVTOL is the next EV and BLADE Urban Air Mobility is the number one company poised to profit!

Do your own DD! I own shares in E X PC

ARK and Cathie have only ever bought 3 SPACs PRE-MERGER. Those SPACs are EX PC, LG VW and IP OB (which became OPEN).
EX PC is already allowing BLADE to use the services of Ross Aviation which the team behind EX PC has a stake in. If you want to get into the Air Taxi space this is the only stock available right now.

It’s a TREMENDOUS show of confidence from ARK to buy a SPAC pre-merger by the way. In 73 days, approximately, ARK is launching ARKX their Space ETF. Part of what they’re looking to invest in for this new ETF are Air Taxis by the way. ARK will likely buy even more shares to include it into ARKX.

Current investors in BLADE include:
Airbus, Lerer Hippeau, Raine Ventures, LionTree Ventures, Barry Diller (Chairman, IAC Inc.), David Zaslav (CEO of Discovery, Inc.) and Eric Schmidt (former CEO of Google). Ian Osbourne of Hedosophia also has a stake. Osbourne is Chamath’s partner but Chamath has no skin in this. BLADE has recently expanded to India and furthermore is set up so that they own ZERO aircraft across the company.

Institutional ownership is 81% of the float by the way! 63 institutions own a stake in EX PC:

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/expc/institutional-holdings

Finally, BLADE is the number one organ transport service in the Northeast! Yes, a helicopter and jet taxi serving Billionaires, millionaires and wannabes is cool AF but ultimately their logistics to transport precious organs rapidly to save lives is what has hooked me.

I have looked into investing in SpaceX myself. For small-timers like me (less than $20M investment), the only avenue is a so called special purpose vehicle (SPV), an LLC that in total attracts $20M+ of investment, and is then able to purchase part of SpaceX. Usually, investment minimums are $200-250k, since the max number of investors in an LLC is apparently 100. Unfortunately, the SpaceX SPV's I've found charge outrageous fees. 5% up front, then 2% annually and finally 20% of any profit. That could work for a couple of years, but I think SpaceX is at least a 20 year investment horizon. It may be be the most valuable company in the solar system by then, by some margin, but still.

Other ways to get some SpaceX exposure, which others have mentioned, includes buying GOOG (perhaps 0.5%), and mutual funds BPTIX (3%), or BFGIX (2.6%), which all pretty much sucks.",2021-01-16 16:59:53

BlackBerry does stuff,8,kysbva,,117,1610834129,"TLDR; If you are here for a lot rockets, here you are 🚀 This post contains info about BlackBerry.

I'm new here, this is my first DD post. Be gentle, retards.

# Intro

Let's start this off by saying this post has no PT, no stock opinion, no predictions on stock movement, it isn't about the stock or the moon. I do own shares, since I like 'em. You don't have to.

This post is about BlackBerry and what they do, since some of the yolo-ers here don't really know what they are buying into. Basically what I have done for you is went to their website, looked at their products and wrote some down. This is far from everything.

# Stuff they no longer do

**Smartphones**

In 2015 BlackBerry made their last smartphone: The BlackBerry Priv. According to a company with the name of a banned ticker that starts with a C and ends with NET (7.6/10) and Techradar (4/5) it was a decent phone. But BlackBerry lost its share in the smartphone sector and made the correct decision to stop.

# Stuff they do

**License their name for smartphones**

Since 2016, TCL made some BlackBerry phones, however they lost the rights to do that in August 2020. In India Optiemus is a BlackBerry licensee for the Indian market. In 2020 OnwardMobility acquired the license to make phones in BlackBerry's name, and they'll release a 5G BlackBerry device with Android and a physical QWERTY keyboard in 2021. (Which I probably will buy with my $BB gainz)

**Software (mostly CyberSecurity)**

You should check out BlackBerry's YouTube channel which contains quite a lot of videos about their products (since y'all can't read that well) [BlackBerry - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLnFGgerRGKlId9uo7dRpIw)

I'm not going to pretend like I understand anything of cybersecurity (stuff with authentication, antivirus, endpoint safety, trust,... if you know you know and if you don't know you probably don't have to). I do know however it's very important to businesses and governments and one of the most important and emerging tech sectors. This goes paired with quite a lot of money spent: its a 123 billion dollar industry \[1\]

Their software isn't limited to cybersecurity, but they do take pride in the fact that each of their software solutions are secure and enterprise-grade. They provide a file sharing application (BlackBerryWorkspaces), a crisis communication system (BlackBerry AtHoc), a BYOD solution (BlackBerry Work), messaging (BlackBerry Connect), ... you see where this is going.

**Automotive**

This actually too is software, but we'll split it up because this one is big.BlackBerry QNX is ""a real-time OS plus virtualization, safety and security solutions for tomorrow’s critical embedded systems"". Basically it's the software running your car, for which car manufacturers can develop. With cars becoming more and more digital, this becomes more and more important. Here's a video [BlackBerry QNX - The Platform for the Car - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9iggiTTbC8)BlackBerry IVY is ""a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology"". Basically this will take cars to a whole new level of customization and connectiveness. Here's another video [BlackBerry IVY - Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDnUNENSoY)BlackBerry Radar is ""a complete asset tracking solution providing reliable visibility to trailer, chassis, containers and equipment."" Here's another video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8dOnzd-Y5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8dOnzd-Y5M)

BlackBerry does more than written above. Like a lot of companies. They do stuff.

"A really easy and good way to make money, 100% working!",0,kysbgs,,51,1610834093,"Today I want to share a really 100% working way on having a passive income! I know it will be hard to believe, but you can earn 50-100% income from any invested amount of money without doing much anything - only topping up, checking income, reinvesting or transferring as dollars or cryptocurrency!

Why does Google pay youtubers for shown ads? It is because ads generate income for Google and Google shares it with youtubers, whose videos featured the ad! Anyway... Listen now:

You might think it is a scam, I though myself too, until I delved deeper into it.

The method of earning money I want to share is very similar. You invest as much money as you wish in this website and the robot starts using your money to provide ads campaign in the background. Each day robot uses fraction of your money and each day you get a return, called cashback, which is usually 30-100% more than what robot took.

Robot usually uses your invested amount during the month (30 days), so if you invested $100, you should expect $150-$200 return. If you invest $1000 -- $1500-$2000 in a month. You get the idea?

The return comes as cashback in small amounts each day. However for you to own the each cashback there is an expiration time (30-80 days), it depends on the robot targeted market return policy - however it is not a big deal or concern for us.

So, do not hesitate and try it out!

GME and BB is old news. BB might go up in the next week with more announcement but GME is gone bros. Move on. 

Let me summarize.

Robinhood Analyst 98% Buy Rating

MarketWatch Analyst averages BUY rn.

Price much lower than its value.

Jack Ma recently invested a whole lot in his own EV.

Stimulus coming soon. You think Amazon will go up? Alibaba will too.

the new boss is in favor international trading, including China. US investors will continue to be able to invest in Chinese stocks, such as BABA.

Do a bit of research and you'll see the obvious.

$GME keep 💎🙌🏻 strong,24,kyrxcs,,65,1610832751,"Guys,

Saw a lot of posts discussing the comparison of Gamestop and Volkswagen squeezes. Should it be the same or we already hit the targets. Bears keep increasing shorts, should you be worry, should you be contrarian of positivity in this sub and sell you shares? This is the end, you would ask?

As you could remember from The Big Short, our lord and daddy M Burry got in his put position way earlier the crash happened and that time everyone that knew the crash is inevitable could not believe that the housing market still increased everyday, because institutions kept lying in media and kept playing their boomer game. This is the key.

Same story with $GME. We know, the short squeeze is inevitable, but they still increase shorts (and keep us under pressure), because they think they will win. We are RIGHT and they are WRONG. They think we will fall. They think we are a flock of sheeps, and they are dogs, that control us. This will not happen. 

We just need to wait with our 💎🙌🏻, the short bubble will pop.

Tldr: The upside potential is almost infinite. Hold your shares, it will be a bumpy road next week or weeks, but eventually we will see the moon live with your eyes flying on that

PSA for anyone who wants to join the GME gang,1,kzgxoa,,8,1610923434,"As you might be aware Lord Cohen tweeted earlier indicating that the stock price is peanuts and/or a reference to NASA and rockets 🚀🚀🚀

The last time RC tweeted you know what happened straight after to the stock price? Not much tbh, it did go up a bit but nothing special. 

Do you know what happened a couple of days later? A day so green that the stock was up 90% at one point. 

The stock market is still so slow to react to news and also pretty bad at digesting the news as well. I mean it took the market 2 days to fucking realise that RC and his 2 former Chewy mates joining the board is a positive plus the positive news regarding Q4. 

So why am I saying this?

Well if RC has tweeted today, he might announce something tomorrow or Tuesday that is bullish af. Will the market react quicker? Probably. But if you are quick on the button you can get in there asap before a spike upwards. This might be the last time the stock is at these levels for a long long time. 

Forget about technical analysis. TA only works when market conditions haven't changed. TA is good for investing on a non-news day. This GME shit does not conform to technicals. I could walk down Wall Street and show every trader the chart before the 90% spike day and I bet none would guess it. 

What should you do then? Buy GME shares before it's too late. Even if it's just one share, you could turn $35  into $350, subtract your initial investment and spend the rest on your wife's boyfriend.

TLDR: Get into GME before it's too late. Diamond hands. Fuck Melvin.

I wonder if there is any relation between Ryan Cohen and Steve Cohen?

This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is to come with respect to GME.  Should likely be flagged as NSFW as for many this will be a masturbatory aid for many until the markets open.

**Pre-amble**

I had an epiphany last night and the world just starting make sense. Instead of being overcome by a wave of relief and calmness, I was crushed by a feeling of dread and experienced one of my restless nights of my life. Respite only came by drowning out my thoughts with a bottle of bourbon. 

This first post outlines why GME will experience a short squeeze in the very short term. Dread is the pending dead of this community - undue blame will come from the media with WSB and retail traders in general to take the immediate brunt of the assault. With the additional media attention will come calls for regulation of financial derivatives and further assaults on the ‘gamification’ of investing. This post is just to set the foundation of the actual record on what is going to come.  

Those that are active in this community or have been lurking for the past couple years can attest to the increasing media attention that WSB has been receiving. This growth is now exponential with Jim Cramer basically leading a WSB public relations campaign and providing near daily commentary to his audience. There has been a material shift in dynamics in this subreddit over the past year. Many new faces of which quite frankly are financially illiterate. Please do your own research and understand how financial markets and derivates work – I have made this as friendly as possible but if you can’t grasp it get your wife’s boyfriend to simplify it for you.  

Many of you will not with in the financial markets and not yet grasp the scope of the WSB community as a whole, which is collectively its own hedge fund. The userbase is the working class looking to break out and live some kind of semblance of normal life, chasing the American dream, which is only getting further and further out of reach. We are little guys and accordingly rely on free brokerages like Robinhood, which results in our collective trade execution being complete garbage. Buying into a position results in thousands of users spamming the ask price on Robinhood and driving up market price. If we were a proper hedge fund, the aggregate positions would be acquired through algorithms co-located with the exchanges and other than potential volume spikes would only be actionable through review of regulatory filings.  

We also maintain like the largest research group in the country with thousands of users undergoing financial research and compiling DD on potential new plays. This research is compiled, disseminated, and reviewed, and actioned in real-time which is why attention is picking up. 

We are fundamentally disadvantaged hedge fund and to the dismay of the existing financial community we are actually winning. 

Cramer – giving the shifting demographics, I highly suggest you incorporate more rocket emoji’s into Mad Money or let us sponsor our own segment.   

**GME Short Squeeze**

**1. Why can insider purchases/sales move the market** 

Company insiders generally posses more knowledge of a company and when they buy it’s a signal the share price is undervalued and when the sell its overvalued. Capital is a scarce resource and directors of companies are human (or some kind of reptile, robot, human hybrids) and they need money to service their lifestyles. 

In WSB terms, if you are yolo’ing funds for a down payment on your house (or to buy a much nicer house with a lambo in the driveway) do you realize your gains when you hit your goal? This can be a prudent financial decision to satisfy a basic human need (shelter and Lambo’s) and isn’t always a signal that you think the real estate market and Lambo’s are better long-term investments than the stock market. 

Insider trades are a potential signal only.  

**2. What happened last week.** 

From 08Jan2021 close to 14Jan2021 close GME increased 126% from $17.69 to $39.91 (ignoring intraday highs) with the gains partially retreating on 15Jan2021 to $35.50 resulting in a 1-week gain of 101%.    

As per media, the pre-market 11Jan2021 SEC filing with Cohen assuming 3-board seats (Cohen and his 2 Chewy pals Alan Attal and Jim Grube) spurred and increase in retail demand and set off a short squeeze with the Friday declines due to the sale of 810,000 indirectly controlled shares by director James Wolf. 

Media is partially correct in that the Ryan Cohen filing resulting in a material increase in retail investment and drove up the share price, however it wasn’t a short squeeze. The combination of the increased demand and the precariously low float set off a gamma squeeze, which further exacerbating the upwards price movement. 

The James Wolf divestiture for any other company should have been relatively neutral news and should not have resulted in the Friday declines – these shares were indirectly owned shares by Hestia Capital Partners, LP with the sale to adhere to the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital. James Wolf and his wife personally own 50,689 shares (unchanged). James Wolf is on the board due to a proxy battle that goes back to 2019 and it is well covered on pages 13-15 of the 2020 Proxy Statement and is worth a quick read ([https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410\_6](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410_6)). 

As a result, the Friday market reaction is very peculiar. If you manage a portfolio’s for others and the maximum single stock exposure that can be held is 10% for example with that stock increasing in value more than other positions, you need to reduce the exposure and rebalance to be within the investor policy statement thresholds otherwise it’s a breach of fiduciary duty. Majority of the disposal was on 12Jan2021 at share price of $19.99 with the remaining 11% (90,000 shares) sold on 13Jan2021 were at $31.08. The requirement to rebalance came before the price spike this week and James’s clients missed out on 50% one day gains.

Additional insider sales were noted on 15Jan2020 post market by the outgoing directors (not nominated for the 2021 Director Slate) as follows: Lizabeth Dunn (5,000 shares or 8.03% of holdings at $31.34), Raul Fernandez (34,619 shares or 51.36% of holdings at $35.27 average), Kathy Vrabeck (50,000 shares or 38.60% of holdings at $27.99). This represents an additional 89,619 in shares sold by outgoing directors and would be relatively normal given. This should cause an additional market decline on Tuesday absent any other information, however as above these trades should be relatively neutral signals and likely would have occurred with or without a price run up during the week.  

What is currently missing is additional filings for additional share acquisitions of Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube that will be forthcoming in the coming weeks and would displace the \~900,000 shares divested above. 

**3. What is a Gamma Squeeze**

This is going to be an oversimplification, as to understand a Gamma squeeze you need to understand the math behind option’s and the role of Market Makers (“MM”). I am going to keep things simple and only focus on the key points as this has already played out.   

**Delta**: measures the impact of change of the underlying asset. Hopefully you retards understand what a share is and if the share price goes up $1 the price of the share will also go up $1 and shares have a delta of 1. The delta on options will constantly change as the price changes (this is measured by Gamma below), however what is important is that far out of the money options have a delta closer to 0 and deep in the money options have a delta closer to 1 (or -1 if they are puts). Hypothetical example: a call option that as a current delta of 0.7 will go up $0.70 in price for a $1 increase in the share price, as the share price increased the delta will also increase to say 0.71 and then 0.72 and so on. 

**Gamma**: measures the rate of change of Delta. This measures how much the delta will increase with every increase in the share price and will be the highest when the options are at the money. 

**Market Makers**: the MM’s trade for their own account and make money based on bid-ask spreads (stock and options) and will look to be delta neutral. MM’s create most of the liquidity in the stock market.  

With that out of the way, what happened with the gamma squeeze?  Well, this is thanks to our friends at Melvin Capital Management LP (“Melvin”) who is well know and documented to death on this boards. As a special thanks to Melvin we should chip in with $100 when they set up their Go Fund Me account next week as none of this would be possible without their assistance. Cole’s notes are below.  

Melvin’s most recent filing dated 16Nov2020 disclosed a position of 54,000 put options and has been documented that the open interest was on 15Jan2021 24p.  ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml))  

The Put options would have allowed Melvin to sell 5,400,000 shares (7.83% of total GME shares) at $24 to a 

MM. The MM would have hedged the delta on this position by selling shares short. As the puts went from ITM to ATM to OTM, the market make would have continued to manage a delta neutral position through buying the stock (covering shorts), buying back puts, or buying calls all which would have created positive price pressure.  

Cohen’s board appointments set everything in motion, share price started spiking, and to remain delta-neutral the MM’s exacerbated the upside price movements as above (due to the changes in delta). Positive price movements and FOMO on a short squeeze continued to drive up the price (especially with WSB buying deep OTM options and volatility spiking). This defines the price movements on 13Jan2021 the previous downward pressure of the MM short position was unwound. 

**4. Synthetic shares and Regulation SHO**

When you short a stock you borrow a share, sell it with the intent of buying in back at a later date for a cheaper price. When the Borrowed stock is sold, there is now a synthetic share that has been created and you think of this as a legal IOU.   

Naked shorting is illegal with an exception for the MM’s, which as noted above, is completed to remain a delta neutral position on the security. For all other players that are shorting, they need to locate and borrow the share before they can short it. When there is a purchase or sale and the underlying share certificate is not delivered it is reported as a failure to deliver. Regulations are in place on short sales and a quick summary is available on [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) 

Threshold Securities are equities that have aggregate fail for 5 days, and they pop up on this fun list ([https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)). GME has been on the Threshold security list since 08Dec2020 or 29 trading days. 

The relevant provisions for GME right now are the below: 

Rule 201 – Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker (or the alternative uptick rule). This was triggered on Friday due to the 10% price decline and will remain in place for Tuesday. At a high level, if the market crashes or continues to fall, this rule is in place to protect the long positions and allow them to exit before new short positions can be created. 

Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement. If a security is on the Threshold securities list for 13 consecutive settlement days, shares must be immediately purchased to close out failures to deliver. This rule is supposed to be in place to protect against naked short selling and market manipulation, however it isn’t really enforced and OSTK (Overstock.com) is a prime example as they made it all the way to 669-days ([https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list](https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list))   

What is enforced is unfortunately enforced is protection for the short sellers, the institutions and hedge funds that are the 1%, and when Overstock tried to push out a dividend which would spur a short squeeze, they didn’t like this (lawsuit was dismissed and reopened Jan2021). [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19) 

There have been rallies on WSB to engage the media and some people have sent in formal complaints, however there is enough information to infer that markets might not be fair as they seem. As per the pre-amble, the collective community has always been fighting an uphill battle. 

**6. Ryan Cohen’s Twitter Profile**

For any of you following Ryan Cohen on twitter, his most recent post was today with a meme of Dumb and Dumber “so you’re telling me there’s a chance”

He is building a social media presence that previously didn’t exist and everything appears to be focused on aiding what was building up to be a proxy battle for GME. At this point the dude could tweet a video of himself having sex with a pig and I would buy more GME shares (direct reference to Black Mirror S1E1 – The National Anthem)   

The historical tweets have generally referenced more share purchases or material pending discloses (board seats), however the underlying is giving fair warning to the short holders to exit positions. Some of the previously deleted tweets are not back and he likely realized that once posted there was no taking them down. 

**7. Short Interest Position**

Short Interest is the number of shares sold short that have not been covered or closed out. Short Interest is formally published to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) twice a month and daily reports published 2 hours post market close ([http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)) 

*Processing img o6i5x4u0qyb61...*

What is import on all of this is that the current short interest on the company is 79.52 million shares with only 69.75 million shares issued by GME. The 31Dec2020 short interest position was 67.98 million shares, so in 2021 the short positions have grown by 11.54 million shares and there was no actual covering last week. 

What we know is that if the price continues going up the shorts will at one point be forced to buy 80 million shares. 

**6. Volume Reconciliation and Price Volatility** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=2207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d

The last 10 trading days (all of 2021) is depicted above. From 02Jan2021 to 12Jan2021, the average daily volume was 7.95 million shares with the respective volume from 13Jan2021 to 15Jan2021 being 114.50 million, 93.72 million, and 46.75 million shares. 

So, what the fuck is going on? Face appearance looks like volume has surged, and liquidity has increased (more buyers and sellers). 

So back in my pre-amble, I mentioned a fundamental disadvantage that WSB maintains on trade execution as the big players have trading algorithms on servers co-located with the exchanges. The massive increase in the short positions was used to defend a short squeeze, which by all rights should have been set off on 13Jan2021 absent this unfair advantage.  

The cost of the shorts defending their position was opening an additional 11.54 million short positions the long security holders gobbling up these securities. Why would they do this? Well, it’s their last stand, the magnitude of potential losses in a short squeeze would result in many of the short holders being liquidated and if they started covering their shares throughout the week the volume would have disappeared and the stock price would have been going up dollars each tick. 

In section 2, I noted that the price action on 15Jan2021 was peculiar as the news was neutral. Well, this is our friends is volatility at play, any news (or a tweet from Ryan Cohen like his Dumb or Dumber tweet today) will result in material swings in the stock price as there isn’t any float remaining – the same shares being traded back and forth hundreds of times a day with additional long positions resulting in the 14Jan2021 and 15Jan2021 volume declines. 

For those like Crayons, I am not a fan of technical analysis; however, the last 3 days looks awfully like a bull flag in the above chart, when you considered the price suppression on 13Jan2021.  

**7. What will come**

As many are aware, many brokerages started increasing the margin rates on GME to 100% - Brokerages are afraid of their exposure and don’t want to get caught. 

Cohen lit the final fuse with his tweet today and we are going to lift off next week.

The short interest being over 100% is unprecedented and this should by all rights be the most aggressive short squeeze ever witnessed in the financial markets. 

I started writing this post yesterday as I was hoping to be able to reconcile a price target for exit. There are a ton of factors at play, however I truly believe now that some of the original posts about this being an infinity squeeze are correct. The $100 million shelf offering, will not be sufficient, and GME will need to announce an additional offering to provide the necessary liquidity for this to fully unwind.

My personal exit strategy: 10% of holding at $1,000, with an additional 10% to be sold every $1,000 price increment.",2021-01-17 16:47:06

Don’t get me wrong, I am ecstatic about recent movements and have been lucky enough to have already been duct taped to the rocket since before the Dec. jump, no plans on stopping now. 
*and I seem to have lost the scissors oops*

That being said,

I’m getting some wildly culty signals and seeing an almost propagandized inundation in and around GME of positive feedback loops and confirmation bias. It is quite a fine line between a movement and a literal cult. Many people in the past have wound up in a cult, under the guise of a religion or social movement, without knowing it was/is or refuse to believe it is. 

I could probably throw some valid evidence and psychology shit in here to back up that blatantly presumptuous assertion but I’m retarded and not a psychologist and honestly that’s just a lotta work that I don’t wanna do


To be fair, 

It really isn’t hurting anyone, with the exception of the bad market meanies, and I’ve never seen a community that I’ve taken place in, ALL rally behind a common and just cause and with this much fervor. The cause being SCREWING THE MAN AND DRAINING HIS ENTIRE TENDIE VAULT. I feel like I should feel morally icky about this, but I also feel like I got in at the tippy top of a pyramid scheme that only pumps rich assholes money upward. 

This is a cause that not JUST you and everyone’s mother can get in on, but even your wife AND her boyfriend. Further, I’ve really only lurked around the sub up until recently but over the last year, this sub has never been more positive and actively engaged before until this week. Everyone is seemingly pretty happy to be here, whether it be simply for the ride, the absolute fucking truckload of potential tendies, or to literally have a shot at being a part of a historic moment proceeding a historic year. If this happens, you bet your diamond-fisted phat future tendies that this will be in the history books. Or maybe some obscure textbook that’s an optional read for your retarded kids Econ class. 

So if this is what a cult feels like, then I’m honestly pretty okay with that.

$TWTR appears to be a good potential buy 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,1,kzfmmc,,62,1610919442,"This is not financial advice. Trades should not be made on the information presented below. You should do your own DD. Everything below is a matter of opinion and is subject to change, and should be verified. This is also my first DD, so I apologize in advance for mistakes that may be present below. If you do see anything, please call it out in the comments.

Twitter ($TWTR) appears to be on sale, with good signs of upside. Twitter's share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform. Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events (i.e. FB and the Zucc). This has left shares on sale, with some appearingly positive buy signals on $TWTR.

Bull Case: Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future. While WSB might not like TA, I think it can be useful for making price projections, especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously.

&amp;#x200B;

[red = low where we are; blue = two other interesting lows](https://preview.redd.it/nojbl40jbyb61.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0)

The stock has a strong up trend-line (support, blue) that is touched 3-4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally (March-Present). The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues. At these two points, it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud, which can act as an additional support level. Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI (of roughly 40) in the purple pane. After both of these lows, a substantial retracement occurs, often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly.

Note: values below are estimated

The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support, it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high. In this first, this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June, falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline, and then rockets back to 35 within 2-3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks (gain of approximately 20% with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35). Similarly, in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October, falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November (indicated by the second blue arrow), which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks (mid December), and then continues to increase beyond that. This represents a gain in excess of 25% from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52. 

At present (red arrow), the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that's been seen in the pandemic rally, falling below 30. This suggests that the stock is oversold, and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future. Moreover, the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline, two supports that were observed in the previous two examples. There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom, as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price. This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future. Buying in now (45.18) and setting a price target around the previous high (55.87) could be return a profit of roughly 23% based on previous patterns. The time horizon for this gain is relatively short, with expectations of around 2-6 weeks based on the two previous trend-line touches (blue). With the oversold RSI condition, it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously.

Disclosure of Concerns: Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline (albeit not by much). If the price does fall further, this could suggest indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse. I think due to the oversold RSI, this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range. Moreover, while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance, the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways (note how after the second blue arrow, price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud). Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns. The climate around Twitter isn't positive at present, and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes, or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve. Even after the Trump presidency has ended, twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration. One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters. This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office, with accusations of unfairness already in the air.

TLDR; $TWTR appears to have positive upside. Projections may suggest a gain of over 20% over a span of about 2-6 weeks based on previous price patters. However, there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position.

Positions in $TWTR: None. I made this DD for fun. If you are interested in purchasing $TWTR shares or calls, I highly encourage doing your own DD before you buy in. This is not financial advice.

By my reckoning we have about a week before NVAX South African PH-II. In preparation I have half my account in 02/19 130c options. 

Hopefully GME will squeeze hard Tuesday. I currently have the other half of my portfolio in 02/19 40c options. 

Alternately GME might be flat and NVAX may hit.  Whichever comes first I’m going to chain these two events together. If NVAX pops I’ll roll profits into shares. If GME, I’ll accumulate more options in NVAX.

**Possible merger (the biggest gamble by far):**

The[ $6 billion merger between China’s two largest games live streaming companies](https://variety.com/2020/gaming/asia/china-games-streaming-huya-and-douyu-to-merge-1234801202/) Huya and DouYu

[On Dec. 14](https://m.weibo.cn/status/4582108007237649?), China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced that the government has started to investigate the merger between[ DouYu](https://esportsobserver.com/tag/douyu/) and[ Huya](https://esportsobserver.com/tag/huya/), which focuses on the concentration of undertakings in Variable Interest Entity (VIE). To simplify it, it is an anti-monopoly investigation.

**A little about DouYa:**

$1.80 Revenue per share (roughly $.10 per share per quarter growth)

91M in gross profit

35.1 EBITDA

DouYu: Price $12.14

Market Cap 3.896B

**Fun stuff to consider:**

esports has been approved by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) as a medaled sport in the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. In addition, China’s esports industry also saw a multi-million dollar investment by a game publisher to an esports organization.

**My own trendlines:**

Long term trendlines of \~$21.73 (red line below) after bouncing off of the short-term 30 min trendline (the purple below) or $18.14 based on fib sequences, means that they are (IMO) bottomed out and the weak hands have sold, leaving a ton of room for growth. 

IF it stays above this red, long term trendline, it will be a $40 stock by summer. On top of that, IF the merger goes through though, this thing will be much, much higher than that even.

**Conclusion: I only got diagnosed with autist this past week, but have been trading for \~6 years now and haven't seen something like this before.

Don't get me wrong, I love watching GME gang making hella money, and I almost joined in a time or two.

“Tesla bears have seen more than $38 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to data from S3 Partners. By comparison, the next-biggest loss for short sellers was on Apple Inc., at just under $7 billion, S3 data shows.”


How long did it take?


“The short squeeze has been going on all year. It’s been an angled straight line down”


And WHY were they sqouze?

Thoughts on GME in the context of digital gaming platforms,1,l05urt,,6,1611009964,"So I am a PC/Console gamer and I‘ve been thinking where GME with Ryan Cohen can actually step in and disrupt the industry.

1. First: he will obviously eliminate more and more stores and sell the stuff online probably adding more PC components and so on. This one is a no brainer but still tied to the fact that bears love: increasing digital sales and decreasing disk sales (which still now account for 50% of game sales nevertheless)

2. Second, and most important: as a gamer I am super tired of multiple platforms. You need to buy your game on PS, then PC, then if you want to play on the train or airplane you buy another copy for Switch. In the end you end up owing multiple copies of games which is super duper annoying and empties your wallet. I think here lies the big chance for GME and disruption as such. If Ryan finds a way to have some kind of „single sign on“ gaming account being linked to all the platforms and we then just exchange games there or activate needed subscriptions or game versions for a small extra payment this would be really nice. For sure it will be very difficult talks with all the platform owners, but still a huge chance. If you look over to GOG, they are trying to do something like this combining the accounts at least in one view and having sync with Steam for several games. My 2c is that actually here lies the big chance for GME, or however the company will be called in the future.

Let me know your thought. Much appreciated.",2021-01-18 17:46:04

How to play GME when the squeeze is happening,1,l05r5c,,21,1611009657,"Correct me if I'm wrong, ideally, if all of us follow the price of GME by putting stop loss that follow the squeeze, we should be able to maximize our gains, is that right? What are the downside of doing this?

For example, when the price will pass $100, we put a stop loss at $80/90 than the price go up to $200 and we move the stop loss accordingly to let's say $180 and so on and so forth. 

by doing so we will reduce our phycological selling pressure and we maximize the gains, especially if all of us will do this, we allow the price to grow till pluto without triggering any selling order, is that correct?

GME Short Squeeze: My Exit Strategy,1,l05ono,,17,1611009446,"Hello fellow retards, 

I have been seeing a lot of questions on other threads from people totally new to investing who are either looking to buy GME shares on Tuesday, or already did so on Friday wondering when they should exit. 

For those who have been keeping up with this sub and GME, you have probably seen many DDs circulating with figures like $1000 PT. 

Now, let me be extremely clear, this is not a DD, this is simply me making my own personal exit strategy public for the retards who have absolutely no idea what to do.

Let’s start with the facts:

1. $1000 PT is NOT unrealistic. If you still think this is a unrealistic PT, please refer to the 2008 VW SS and the many posts, videos, articles, blogs, and whatever the fuck else that break it down 

2. Although GME has the potential to be the craziest short squeeze we have ever seen, it is NOT directly comparable to VW since VW SS was primarily caused by only 1% shares float actually being available while the short interest was only around ~10.6%

3. GME has a short interest of roughly 130-140%, and shares float available around 40%. Im not going to pretend to make sense of those numbers for you, please do your own research and make your own conclusions.

Now with that out of the way here is my position and my strategy, and what I recommend to those who have no idea wtf they are doing:

I have 500 shares @ 34.50, I’ll be selling 20% or 100 shares at PT of 150. This is primarily because of personal reasons and me actually needing to liquidate some cash. 

After that I will continue to hold 400 shares while closely monitoring the volume and price action on the stock. If I continue to see high volume and price trending up, I’m holding until 500 minimum, if things slow down I might reevaluate middle of the week (Wednesday, Thursday) and maybe look to shave out more shares on Friday before market close. However, I am expecting a very strong buyer presence so chances are after pulling my first 100 out at $150, I’ll hold the rest and look to sell at $1000.

Now here’s my advice to those who are unsure: the ultimate exit strategy is one where you are comfortable with your gains, HOWEVER also minimize the probability that you’re going to miss the peak of the squeeze. DO NOT sell ANY shares below $150 (this is around what I estimate the actual value of this company to be) and after $150 make your own decision but keep in mind that this thing has the potential to blow past $1000.

Please remember this is not financial advice, and chances are I’m just as if not more retarded then you so take that with a grain of salt.

Happy trading, let’s make these fucking shorts bleed on Tuesday. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕",2021-01-18 17:37:26

** Introduction **

Hi. I'm a flaming 🌈🐻. I saw a company that was dying, applied boomer logic, and decided to borrow a ton of shares, dump them into the market, and drive down their share price. I now hold a wad of cash, but I owe my broker shares.  No problem, I thought, I'll buy back those shares when the company goes bankrupt and I'll get to keep the cash.

I got all my buddies involved in spreading boomer logic about the company having no future, and I thought it'd be pretty sweet to make some dough off of a chain of irrelevant stores dying. It's just business.

This seemed like a pretty safe bet. I mean, who would argue against a retail store selling physical games, operating at losses, closing stores, etc -- who would argue that it won't eventually end up like blockbuster?

*It might still be a safe bet that they go bankrupt, but unfortunately that doesn't matter anymore...*

** My Situation **

I borrowed these shares, and sold them on the market. I have a wad of cash, which is cool, but now the shares have gone up in value (something about positive outlook and some young stud that people believe in). At some point I need to buy the shares back to give to my broker. (This is called covering -- I might be a 🌈🐻, but I'm also an autist).

My broker says they're worth $X each, and I borrowed Y shares, so they're charging me interest on $X * Y... every single day.  The interest rate they are charging me is also getting ridiculously high, because my broker has trouble finding shares for me to borrow.

Those profiteering bastards are charging me high interest because they know shares of GME are hard to come by, and they are taking advantage of me. Fuckers. I want to switch to another broker, but they're doing the exact same thing!

Fuck, this fucking sucks.

** Digging my own grave **

Ok, don't panic. I have a plan.

I have a lot of money, and the stock has gone up a bunch already. I'll borrow *more* shares, dump them on the market, and when people see the price go down, they'll think to themselves: ""Well shit, I just gained 100% in the last month, but now the stock is going down... I guess I should just sell"".

Hopefully everyone will apply that same logic, the price will go down, and I can start buying back the shares to cover. I'll give it a shot...

(Jan 15th happens)

...Ok, that worked, a little bit. The stock price went down, but it didn't tank as much as expected. Are these guys going to sell or what?

I don't know how much longer I can stomach this fucking interest.  Also, what are the other 🌈🐻's going to do?  Do I need to worry?  Oh... shit...

** My Situation, Part 2 **

Ok, so it turns out that I'm not the only 🌈🐻. In fact, combined, 🌈🐻's owe their brokers more shares than exist. This fucking sucks, because if *I* want to buy shares to cover, they probably do, too.

What are they going to do?  Are they going to cover?  Because, if they do, they're going cause the price to go up, and then when *I* want to buy shares, I'll have to pay even more! Fuck!

Should I cover now?

Wait a second, what's this on the news? People are catching wind that there are so many 🌈🐻s in GME, and that we are suffering. FUUCCCK.... what if people with shares use this to their advantage? What if they see how desperately I need to buy shares off of them and simply refuse to sell until, like, $200 or some ridiculous price?

Let me Google this... OH FUCK. It's called a short squeeze. Apparently this happened in similar conditions to VW and KBIO and... what the fuck... their share prices went up like 10x and 100x in a couple of days? How the fuck?  Makes no sense, couldn't possibly happen to me.

Ok, think. How about I just cover my position? I can go out on the market and buy back all the shares I owe. No big deal.

Let me check the order book.  Uh... this fucking blows. I can buy back like 10% of the shares I owe, but then the price of the stock will have gone up like 30%.  Every time I try to cover, the stock price will just keep going up! There are even a ton of people who won't sell to me unless I pay them $420.69.  What the fuck?!

Where are all the people with the shares? Come on, they've seen so much gains recently, just flip them for a profit!

Let me check.  Um... I'm seeing a lot of institutional investors. Well, these guys don't really sell that often, and they're probably smart enough to see I'm in a shitty situation. There's this Ryan Cohen dude who owns a bunch of shares, but he just tweets random bullshit and doesn't seem like he will sell me any. There's this message board full of people just as retarded as me... but if *I* know how desperate I am, they probably know that too.

Alright, calm the fuck down. I can think of a way out of this.

** What Can I Do? **

Ok. I'm calm. Let me take inventory of what I'm dealing with here.

Pros:
* I have a ton of cash.

Cons:
* GME has gone up in price
* Maybe GME's fundamentals have improved?
* I have borrowed far too many shares
* I keep having to pay interest on these borrowed shares
* Everyone is aware that my back is against the wall
* If a short squeeze happens, I'm fucked
* Shareholders don't appear to be easily spooked
* I'm retarded

Ok. I lost. **The plan now is to minimize my losses.**

I need to buy back shares for as cheaply as possible, without causing a huge fucking squeeze.

How about I go to some big shareholders and cut them a deal? I'll buy a ton of shares from them for, say, 3x the current market value. This is probably better than just going onto the open market.  The question is, will they bail me out, and at what price?  Let me take a look at institutional investors. Oh, fuck, it's pretty spread out. The best I can do is make deals with a handful and cover maybe 30% of my shares?  Not really sure, actually, as I'm a fucking autist and too lazy to do all the digging.

Alright, well how about I try to spook retail investors, like those WSB retards?  What if I cover a ton of shares at once, bump the price up another 50%, and hope they all think this is the squeeze?  I'll just sit there and buy back shares as they panic sell.  If it works, I can try it again later.  If it doesn't, well, at least I covered some shares.

I think I'll try that this week.

---

Ok, that's as far as I can stomach. You see how shitty it is to be a 🌈🐻 right now, so don't bail them out by selling shares until you're sure all the 🌈🐻's are panicking. They made their bed, make them sleep in it.

Or, go right the fuck ahead and sell your shares.  The 🌈🐻's will still be fucked. It will only prolong the inevitable, and those of us who continue to 💎🤲 will have *more* leverage for when they inevitably need to cover.

Personally, I'm waiting for an ignition of this MOASS 🚀, and not basing it on any price movement unless it's at least triple digit percentages.  I think ignition will come in a form of some announcement by some 💎🤲 announcing they acquired a ton of shares and will not sell them to shorts.  This is how it happened for VW and KBIO.",2021-01-18 17:26:32

To those who are new to this:

HOLD!!! Don't just give away your shares to shorters at the first dip. Patience is key. Take it from me, an idiot who exited Tesla at $300 (from $150) pre-split, and AMD at $20 (from $10), and didn't have the balls to get back in. 

Remember, there is always a risk with stocks, but it's not like the shares you own in GME will go to $0 (at least not this year). There may be unexpected turbulence and dips. Have patience. Nobody knows how this will play out, and it may take longer than expected (let's hope not). But remember also that there are guys here who have put in 5-6 figures into this, so even if everything goes to shit somehow (Cohen exits or is hit by a bus or whatever), there will always be someone who has lost way more than you. In the end, it's just money, more will always come around. But don't spend money you don't have. 

Fuck, even if I lose my whole position, I will have some great memories for the rest of my life about this mf MOASS that did or did not happen.

Hold!

Band of Autists,1,l05axb,,6,1611008310,"I know, another post about gme. But I really wanted to talk about the experience I had over the last week, especially now, on the eve of our great battle. This has literally been the most exciting week of my entire trading career. I've been looking at charts every day,  dreaming about it at night. I haven't done a single piece of work after that opening bell but it was f*cking amazing.

The fact that everyone in this sub is bonding and working together like we're in an actual war is the best. But instead of fighting a bunch of nazis we're fighting short sellers with Melvin Capital as their führer. We are together on the frontline shouting HOLD THE LINE and we will hold it, no matter what.

 The fact that we're facing a big ass war machine with deep pockets doesn't scare us. We don't know if we'll be able to return to our wives with our life savings intact. We don't know if we will be able to beat the big money machines.
But we believe we will. And that's why we will prevail. Because we are part of something greater, something more than just making money. It's about fighting big money and showing them that they can't mess with us. They can try to knock us down but we will always get back up.

And those who stand by me on the day of the MOASS will be remembered. 
We few, 
we happy few, 
we band of autists - for whoever risks his life savings with me is my fellow autist. However humble his birth, that day shall grant him nobility.

And when my son will ask me: ""Dad, we're you a hero in the squeeze?"" I'll tell him: ""No, but I served in a subreddit of heroes""

Posting my new play cuz y'all are good for some laughs so I thought I'd help you autists out.

Goeasy is company based in Canada that gives loans to lower credit quality people. It also leases stuff. With this higher risk, they charge crazy amounts since no one else will lend to these people usually.

Setting aside the ethics, this stock is going to the fucking moon.

Basically they borrow at 3-5% and lend it out at 40%. They take a 10% haircut on bad loans and keep the rest.

1. Price $104.7 CAD and trading at 3.5x revenue. Market cap of 1.55B CAD (1.2B USD)
2. Annual earnings growth of 37% for the last five years
3. Dividend growth for 32% for the last five years
4. Recently reduced their cost of borrowing with new $200M securitization facility at 3.4%.
5. Return on equity of &gt;20%
6. Authorized to buy 10% of stock back this year. Authorized mid-December 2020.

But the fucking icing on the cake - The Management

GoEasy had a minority stake in Paybright which they bought for 34 million in September of 2019. One year later, in December of 2020 they sell it to Affirm for $60 million: 23 million in Cash (CAD) and the rest in shares.

So you might wonder 60-23 = 37 million dollars in shares right? WRONG

GSY received 655,416 shares of Affirm with an additional 468,154 shares if revenue milestones are met.

How much are these Affirm shares worth?

655,416 \* 117 = 77 Million

468,154 \* 117 = 55 Million

Total = 23 million + (77 +55)\*1.28 (for USD to CAD conversion = 23 + 168 million = 192 million.

In one year the investment of 34 million became 192 million. They could buy back 12% of the stock with this gain alone, not including the internal capital generation from operations.

GSY is expected to release results in the 2nd week of February. Probably a 30% dividend increase and if they announce plans to expand to the US, this stock is doubling in a month and could be a 5-bagger.

No options boys. Straight stock only.

GME Misinformation: Bears Attacking Limit Orders,1,l052ww,,75,1611007659,"GME Gang,

First off congrats for the hard fought victories from last week 🚀 🚀 🚀 

But there are more victories on the way, and we have yet to win the war and witness the Mother of All Short Squeezes (MOASS) 🥜 

The pressure is on and the shorts 🌈 🐻 are fuk and they know it. They are desperate.

I’ve been seeing a lot of misinformation being spread saying you need to take down your limit orders of $420.69 because they will be executed at a lower price.

That. Is. Not. True. 💎 🙌🏼 

Per the SEC, limit orders can ONLY be filled when the stock’s market price reaches the the limit price. Until GME touches $420.69, your orders WILL NOT EXECUTE. (After it touches $420.69, it can execute at a lower price but more on that later).

This misinformation stems from the Limit-UP Limit-Down system (LULD). This system establishes upper and lower price bands for the trading price of a stock based on an average price over 5 minute window. 

GameStop (GME) is a Tier 2 security for LULD and is over $3 a share, so it’s price bands are 10%. This means that the best price someone can offer for GME is current price + 10%. If the national best bids are over the upper band then GME will hit a 5 minute trading halt. At the end of the trading halt, the price will reopen based on an auction price by the NYSE. 

Example:

GME is currently $35.50. The upper band is $35.50 + $3.55 (10%) = $39.05. As long as orders come in under $39.05, trading occurs as normal. The trading band will continue to adjust according to the 5 minute average. As long as GME isn’t climbing over 10% in 5 minute windows nothing happens.

If (when) GME squeezes and all of the orders (National Best Bid) comes in at $39.05, GME will enter a “limit state” and hit a trading halt. Trading is paused for 5 minutes. If all of the orders come in over $39.05, then GME will entered a “straddle state” and trading is paused at the discretion of the NYSE

Where does the misinformation come from?

Many people are referencing orders being filled at a lower price. This stems from the fact that during the LULD process, market orders coming in to be filled during this time that are priced aggressively over the upper-band (over $39.05 in our example) will be repriced to fit the price band. Meaning aggressive traders trying to sneak in market orders over the upper band ($39.05) during the chaos of a squeeze will for will be repriced to $39.05. People are falsely claiming that your limit orders will be executed early at a lower price. This is misinformation. 

What’s important is that limit orders remain open when a trading halt is triggered and so your limit order will not be executed until GME reaches $420.69 💎 🙌🏼 

The shorts are almost at the end of their $ROPE and are desperate for shares. They see the thousands of shares priced at $420.69 and are desperately trying to bring that price down. Don’t let the enemy deceive you. Grab some peanuts 🥜 and sit back while Ryan Cohen 👑 counts down for ignition and the GME rocket takes off full speed for the andromeda galaxy 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 

Tldr; your limit orders are safe at $420.69, don’t let the bears 🌈 🐻 scare you

WSB needs to go private,1,l04o32,,19,1611006458,"This sub is constantly on the news, and even though the writing makes us seem like supernatural autistic kids, the connotation is that we are a danger to the ""free market"" and we are to blame for stock price manipulation. In reality, we are idiots with a little extra cash earned from a Wendy's ally after an 8 hour shift, but the media isn't looking at us that way. 

The sub is dramatically growing, and I've seen some 🌈 mods celebrating like it's a good thing. First off, WSB started getting ruined since it became popular, so I'm not sure why mods think growing further is a great accomplishment? Second of all, they're not friendly new-comers. They are either retarded boomers from media attention or StockTwats kids with rocket emojis. Even though I use the 🚀🚀🚀for trading advice, an influx of them is too much to handle. 

I've heard some of you argue that we are ""too valuable"" for reddit to kill us off because we buy lots of their shit. Don't even think for a second that Reddit will give a fuck about you guys if the SEC or even CNBC tells them to shut us down for market manipulation. Reddit won't go through courts and shit to defend a group like us. Hell, we use all kinds of language Reddit would deem ""derogatory"" and the only reason why we haven't been already banned is because we buy too much of their shitty awards and we're considered a ""Finance"" subreddit, which keeps a lot of leftists from even browsing and seeing the way we do things. Otherwise, we would've been banned from the complaints alone; the same thing that happened to all the other ""hateful"" subs. 

If WSB doesn't go private and disappear ourselves, we'll be dicked down by the biggest 🌈🐻 soon.",2021-01-18 16:47:38

LIMIT UP AND LIMIT DOWN RULE - the final word and why you can ignore it.,1,l04lor,,16,1611006266,"I keep seeing tons of posts about the LULD rule. I’d like to clarify because it’s starting to feel like a bear gang ruse. 

If you have a LIMIT SELL order that is WAY above the current ask, this rule DOES NOT APPLY. 

I’m not sure I can be any clearer. 

The rule is for boomers who are trying to buy BB (for example) and mistakenly enter a price of 420.69 when they meant to buy it for 4.2069. The LULD rule steps in to ensure the boomer doesn’t make such a mistake with his precious retirement account that he has stacked over the years due to inexpensive college and housing costs. 

So if you keep seeing these posts (re: GME especially), just ignore.

$SENS DD,8,l0vdr5,,35,1611096457,"I know this stock has run up a lot, but I really think it is worth taking a look at. 

The company? Senseonics. What do they do? Constant Glucose Monitors (CGM)

CGMs essentially read a blood sugar for a type one diabetic throughout the day which means you don't have to do a finger stick. Currently $DXCM makes the most popular CGM on the market which I currently use as I myself am a type on diabetic. 

Senseonics make a different CGM which allows for it to be implanted underneath the skin. This is different from the Dexcom CGM which sits on top of the skin. As someone who uses the Dexcom CGM let me tell you, they occasionally get ripped out and it really sucks. The implantation has to happen around every 90 days at a doctor's office. While this sounds like a pain, as a type one diabetic I have to see my endocrinologist every 90 days anyway so this shouldn't be a deal breaker. 

$SENS is moving towards broader approval for their device and today just got approval for coverage from a major insurer which is huge news. 

Generally, this company really reminds me of $TNDM before it ran up. Great technology just waiting for approval so that diabetics can start using it. 1.25M people have type one diabetes in the United States. The market for this can be huge. If the company continues to gain insurance approvals, it will skyrocket.",2021-01-19 17:47:37

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's and recent market driving news (Jan 19, 2021)",53,l0v2mc,,48,1611095543,"* The market performed strongly today with tech stock leading the way. Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.

* It's another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew ""tool bag"" Left of Citron at 6:58 derailed the party and send shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36 as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.

* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. 

* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.

* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.

* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.

* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the ""stimulus talks are going well"" pumps.

* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.

* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.

* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.

* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close. Housing market index on Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET, jobless claims at 8:30 AM on Thursday, and on Friday PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

"GME: The power of imagination, a fresh value perspective 🚀🚀",40,l0v1wb,,79,1611095483,"First of all well played to everyone today (most of you, not paper handed bitches). That shitron play was literally the raid boss round 1, if we can bring the price back up from that fall then the future is already foretold. They cant possibly having anything stronger than the biggest shorting name in the business, known for massive price manipulations using their ""research"". I will imagine they will try the same shit with unlimited shorts alongside their stream and biden inauguration tomorrow so HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. DIAMOND HANDS, and we shall we rewarded. Obligatory 🚀🚀 🚀🚀

I love deep fucking value in both sense of the words. I have this year exploited a massive value gap in RPS Group in the UK, buying in around 30p (now 80p), a cheeky 250% in 9 months.  GME Position 292 shares @$17

Now,

I want dig dip below the surface of your little smoothbrains and tap into that imagination. Here I will take you through some examples and imagine the future GME. Lets be Aunt Cathie ,like how she imagines branch future outcomes based on existing states. Ie Tesla has good full self driving software way ahead of competitors, therefore it can be the first mover in the autonomous taxi network. At the end of the day our only limit is Lord Cohens imagination.

I want you to consider the whole world of gaming. PC, console, handheld, peripherals and chairs, board games, VR experiences, merch, performance enhancement, esports. I’m sure there are others I haven’t thought of. The name is GAMESTOP, its strong and well known, and is well distributed in the hearts of cities and towns. Its time people stop thinking about its as just a place that will only sell discs like a record store. As an ecommerce opportunity GME can be one stop store for all of these. As far as I understand there is not one decent site that offers all of this under one roof, I have an example in another industry later. Amazon do all this retard.. but who honestly enjoys shopping at Amazon, literally its only good for fast free delivery. Its full of shitty Chinese knockoffs, searching is awful, doesn’t have half the stuff you want, full of fake reviews, and jeff is a wanker and amazon treat their workers like shit. There is a gap in the market for a all-in-one game store with fast free delivery that treats its customers like saints. Any physical stores should reflect this and be like nerd nirvana. Latest cool products, meet ups, board game events, esports tourneys, repairs - community hub for nerds spreading the sweet brand of GME. 

This year I have spent over 1k on gaming stuff, headset, new pc, chair, ps5 to come rip stock. This was a fucking mission having to go all over the internet to find good value and the bits I wanted with all the items ending up arriving at different times. New PC from like 5 different places, Scan, amazon, ebay, Box. Headset from Scan, Chair direct from Secret Lab, monitor from fuck knows where. Would have been so much easier if I good buy it all from one place and get a bulk discount for buying so much shit. 

All these products bring me on to esports which ties into the game industry story. Esports is literally being eaten up by venture capitalists and smart brands. Guess who sponsors ESL, yes fucking Mercedes Benz &amp; DHL, not who you think would advertise (#GrowUp, lel) to supposably greasy fat pale skinned skint young esport neckbeards. What boomers don’t seem to get is that “gamers” aren’t like this, and that they are the incoming middle class, who will create families whose children will be brought up with brands their parents are exposed to. They have well paid jobs like software engineers, doctors, teachers, engineers. This is literally WSB and is why boomers aren’t getting us and GME. I mean look at our god, DFV, he’s quirky but a normal guy and plenty of cash. Both of these companies have not only got PR gold as infamous memes ([We did it reddit! Mercedes embraced the meme : DotA2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/79hb3t/we_did_it_reddit_mercedes_embraced_the_meme/)) have spread, and DHL chants in stadiums have been sung, but are gaining love for sponsoring events people are really passionate about. Gamers love things that support their passion and are very brand loyal and are the right age (18-32) to sow deep brand loyalty. Now imagine GME starts getting involved in these events, sowing its brand in the same way as Mercedes to the same people that will then guaranteed buy stuff at its store. Its literally unbelievable this synergy hasn’t been exploited yet. I would love to see someone address all this stuff that actually knows advertising and marketing well compared to me just reading things over the years.

Next I want to give you an example of some all in one stores that already outcompete Amazon in a certain similar industry. For this I will use bicycles, yes you did hear me right. As some of you will no doubt know the world of bicycles has so much symmetry with gaming. Bicycles owners love having the latest tech and coolest toys, they love upgrading and are super passionate and proud about their hobby and are within an ecosystem both tech wise and like esports e.g Copying the gear of pro cyclists like esports watchers do of pro gamers, watching big youtube channels with further advertised products – this is all gamers in a nutshell. Again I use myself as an example, I use a Sennheiser headset, SteelSeries peripherals. Funnily I have bought these subconsciously via the sponsored products used by the team EG.  Amazon and other mega stores whilst selling some stuff just don’t compete with the specialised all in one ecommerce stores like Wiggle/Chain Reaction Cycles &amp; Sigma Sports. 95% of the bike stuff I have ever bought is from these. They sell everything to do with bikes, clothing (merch), health and nutrition, components, upgrades, the list goes on. Sound familiar? The products and ecosystem are just too technical and complex for some mega store like Amazon to do it properly. Likewise Amazon cannot focus on customer experience like these stores can, which is important for technical products if there is a tech issue or a breakdown- Amazon is too big and spread out for its own good. If you mention Wiggle to someone,” oh yeah that’s the place that sends out Haribo with every order”. Basically, GME needs to integrate itself amongst the wider gaming world and community with strategic partnerships, marketing, and combine this with excellent customer service. I’m sure big daddy Cohen as already cottoned on to this.

Lastly I want to bring your attention to Games Workshop in the UK, its worth checking this out as to how GME may improve itself. Its literally the darling of the London Stock Exchange “The company is the best performing FTSE250 retailer of the past decade”.  More importantly it shows how well a business with significant strategic brick and mortar, and ecommerce presence can perform.

We should note lastly that although we don't have any proof any of this will occur, sometimes you have to believe in the vision laid out by a man to extract ultimate value out of of a play. Cohen is our Elon in this play. 

Hopefully this has opened your imagination to some extra pathways in the GME value thesis. Yours sincerely, a tea drinker. AND FUCKING HOLD YOUR SHARES, LIKE WE HELD THE LINE TOGETHER IN D DAY.",2021-01-19 17:31:23

Alibaba is ready to run,8,l0uzo3,,63,1611095299,"Alibaba is looking poised to run after a quiet breakout from its downward trend.

&amp;#x200B;

After easing of some negative catalysts, the investor outlook on Alibaba is looking increasingly optimistic. With Jack Ma confirmed alive and well, Joe Biden's incoming inauguration, and the removal of Alibaba, Tencent, and others from potential delisting threats, the company is looking oversold in a run-up to its first earnings report since the start of its troubles in late October of last year. Alibaba's main e-commerce business remains unaffected, and the growing Chinese middle class will drive continued growth for Alibaba's main business. Continued investment into cloud computing, entertainment, and many other industries allows Alibaba to diversify its revenue and avoid the anti-monopoly crackdown of the CCP, while still remaining one of the fastest-growing large-cap companies in the fastest-growing country of the 21st century.

&amp;#x200B;

It's clear from Alibaba's EV collaboration with state-owned SAIC Motor that the company is not going anywhere soon. They recently announced a $5-8B bond sale and upsized an existing stock buyback FROM $6b to $10b, signaling confidence in the long-term presence and health of the company. The drama surrounding the canceled Ant Group IPO has proven to be overblown, as it appears regulators will be issuing a slap on the wrist to Alibaba, and restructuring Ant Group (which BABA holds a 33% stake in) to operate more like a typical bank, as opposed to the high-risk, low-collateral consumer lending that has facilitated their rise. Alibaba's transparent cooperation and smooth conduct with regulators will probably earn them more lenient punishments, and the company's critical role in the liberalization of China's economy and their competition on the world stage will make regulators hesitant to kneecap one of their most valuable national assets.

&amp;#x200B;

[3 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/tre93wka6dc61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac2315522cf48600576b3fef53139a445204321)

It found a bottom at $210 and has been slowly edging upwards, trading in a range of $220-250 with strong support and resistance at both levels. The higher highs and higher lows found in the past few trading days help confirm this. This week, the ticker has consolidated around $245 for a push above $250. 

&amp;#x200B;

Actual (not in an endearing way) retards will spout sinophobic propaganda and accusations of 'CCP shill' at anyone who proposes that Alibaba presents a buying opportunity. Smart people make money where there's money to be made. If the GMEs, BBs, and CCIVs of the world seem too speculative and risky for you to put a large stake in, Alibaba is one of the best opportunities you will ever get to invest in one of the most fundamentally solid, profitable companies in the world: large-cap stability with the growth potential of Amazon in 2014.

16 year old looking for an Angel Investor,0,l0uzcu,,67,1611095271,"16 year old looking for an Investor

Hi, I’m 16 and am asking for an investment of 100$ to start a business and I will pay you back. Or you can finance start up fees for 25% of the business.where I will do the work.

Your probably asking why would I want to do this. To be honest it’s because I want to learn how to do e-commerce, setting up a business and managing it.

The idea itself is. Me myself being a virtual personal assistant, where I do practically what any personal assistant does but online with a few added things like managing social media. This becomes a business as I would make a site, a personal email, where people would go to it and buy the service for however long, and if it takes off then I can outsource it or employ other people.

All the income I make will go to you until the finance you’ve exchanged is paid back.

I study economics, business, maths and computing so I have the understanding of how to set a business up and am learning much more advanced things.

Any offers are welcome. Thanks 🙏 for reading.",2021-01-19 17:27:51

🚀🚀🚀 American Well ($AMWL) Abbreviated Write-Up (Comprehensive DD Coming Soon) 🚀🚀🚀,0,l0uwtx,,11,1611095064,"Got a new play for ya'll - American Well ($AMWL). It is one of the larger telehealth providers (primarily competing with Doc On Demand, MDLive and Teladoc)... went public late last year, and seems to be flying under the radar of a lot of people. Check out their S-1 (good place to start). They are differentiated and well positioned to take market share from the 900 pound gorilla in the room, $TDOC, which is currently valued at ~$30bn @ ~70% market share. $AMWL is currently valued at $7bn. A lot of experts in the behavioral health sector believe there is an impending mental health crisis which has been exacerbated by COVID-19. Telehealth will help alleviate the provider supply/demand imbalance. Could see this one running pretty high as it also gets more coverage from retail/institutional investors... There is some negative rhetoric online regarding the perceived COVID-19 bump &amp; whether the recent growth is sustainable... and how ""of course this company would IPO after a large COVID-19 spike,"" but I think there is some permanence here in regard to the adoption of telehealth. A lot of people gave it a trial run through COVID and now realized it as a real alternative to visiting the doc... there may be more permeance than the market is giving credit for.

Some short-term catalysts include the IPO lockup expiring March 16th (March 19th call options already have some activity and are dirt cheap). There is an extremely small public float, and when more investors can pile in this will start to take off... and lead to more ER coverage and retail interest. Oh yeah, Google also invested $100mm in this bad boy. 

AMWL also has some high short interest (due to low float)... so as this continues to run you could see some squeezing. The stock popped the month it IPO'd and has since returned to a better price to enter. Now beginning to see some positive momentum up again (~20% appreciation last five trading days). I'm going to be sizing up my position across various strikes and … will be providing a follow-up post sometime this week with more substance on the Company's core business, investment highlights, points of differentiation, and potential risks &amp; mitigants.

GME - Strategy,23,l1kfmv,,36,1611182313,"The current CEO of Game Stop is [George Sherman](https://news.gamestop.com/leaders/george-sherman).  The preferred CEO, as far as the people reading this are concerned, is [Ryan Cohen](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105969524-190614sacohen.jpg?w=1910&amp;h=1000). Citron Research isn't the only one with twitter fingers. As a collective, we own enough enough shares to ask for a board seat. If we all made a ton of noise asking for the resignation of George Sherman for poor leadership and performance I bet it would have an impact, and likely bolster Ryan's position.

Under George Sherman's leadership GME shares have gone from \~$16 -&gt; sub $3. It has only seen a resurgence due to excitement around Ryan Cohen's potential move into the role of CEO.

We have already seen multiple instances where this group has been able to make it to mainstream news. With enough people pushing the narrative LOUDLY and FREQUENTLY there will be coverage.

This coverage will serve many positive outcomes. First, it will give more attention to GME likely increasing the number of people who see it for the opportunity it is and thus purchasing shares. Secondly, it opens up conversations around George Sherman's performance relative to GME and around its potential future with Ryan Cohen. This clear, constant, and consistent comparison would force more content around this comparison. This should hopefully encourage the board to make a decision sooner, rather than later.

**TLDR:** There are other benefits I could mention but the point is clear. If we loudly demand the resignation of a poor performing executive, of a publicly-traded company, who has a clear and highly qualified competitor interested in his job. This will force the decision-making process to increase in speed.",2021-01-20 17:38:33

""Fore"" real doh, this is gonna takeoff.  The merger of these two companies is mutually beneficial in so many ways.  For one, it lowers the costs of equipment for Topgolf.  Callaway benefits by new golfers being brought into the sport by Topgolf.  It's like going to a bowling alley, far less daunting than scheduling a tee time and being worried about etiquette and other elitist BS at the local country club.  People can get the hang of the sport, without diving into the deep end.  In turn, new folks get exposure to Callaway products as you have to assume every Topgolf becomes a Callaway retailer going forward.  On top of all this, Topgolf's TopTracer tech can be licensed out and has still barely penetrated the market.

Last but not least, the pandemic and it's infinite boredom has positively impacted the sport bringing new people in, and experienced folks out more often just to get out of the house.  I'm sure WFH and the ability to sneak out undetected to play around hasn't hurt either.

Dear WSB autists,1,l1ka2f,,0,1611181833,,2021-01-20 17:30:33
Gamma Watch of Popular Tickers 1-20-2021 Roundup,17,l1k8lo,,182,1611181709,"Due to the growing size of the sub, we've been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks - GME last week, BB Monday.

Gamma is an option term. What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves.

For WSB popular stocks, I believe that about 2/3 - 3/4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates, which means that the dealer is now ""short gamma"", which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves.

That means that as prices move, dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money, because option dealers/market makers ALWAYS win (almost). This means that in some situations, moving over a ""gamma ramp"" (price where there's a lot of gamma) may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma. This in turn makes a ""gamma squeeze"" where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money (similar to short squeeze, which is when shorts are forced to buy, causing yet more buying, so as to not lose more money).

In most cases, gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock, close to zero. But it can be a big deal. In BB's case, I think as much as 2/3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers, and the weak rally today is evidence of that - no gamma ramp. GME is similar - passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week (with dealers doing 2/3 of the buying), now kind of in between several gamma ramps, with dead zones 36-38 and 31-34.

Looking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible. It's a giant lever that can go against you or for you. If price is slightly above a gamma ramp, it's bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly. If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp, it's bullish, because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp, while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers.

Note that when you buy NEW options from dealers, they just do the trade you do initially - buy a put, they sell stock. Buy a call, they buy stock. But from there, price moves cause them to match the stock price movement - they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put, and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call. Make sense? Thought not, work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings.

Keep in mind that in a lot of cases, there's no meaningful gamma, and no price action will occur.

I prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks - GME, BB, PLTR, ICLN,TSLA TLRY, NIO. Note that this tool ([http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/)) assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers, and puts are short gamma. I think when you guys engage a stock, it's more like 3/4 of all gamma is short gamma, put or call.  Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma.

Current popular stock gamma landscapes (IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately... hopefully its loading):

[https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln](https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln)

Gamma is only relevant relative to float. Big gamma matters more on small stocks. You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly, and if this sub lately is any indication, you'll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on. But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data:

**GME** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Very high - Big swings could cause MM's to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares easily.

Reading: Bearish with bearish trend, but possibility of strong bull case on good bid. There is a LOT of gamma ramp, and looking at the picture, we are more 'on top' of the gamma than ""on bottom"" of the gamma. It turns out that the bears favor the ""on top"" position w/ regards to gamma. People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price, which are fuel for the fire down, and can be seen in the graph as put positions. A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above. Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there. If it starts moving down, it will run fast and then slow down at 36/37, then slow down again at 31/32/33.  Good news is that because of all this new put vol, the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward, pushing price up gradually.

**BB** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: High. Big swings could cause MMs to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares.

Reading: Bearish, with bullish trend. This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp. Since then, peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp. Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly, but not much lower quickly. Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying.

**PLTR** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Moderate. Float is theoretically a billion shares, and swings could make MMs buy/sell perhaps 1/4 to 1/5 of that.

Reading: Slightly bullish. There's a sharp ramp down, but also up.. and  a strong buying trend will move this up, and there's large block of gamma at $30.

**ICLN:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Low. Why? Because this is an ETF that can be made/destroyed by issuer on demand.

Reading: Actually a little bullish. This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day. I know, weird?

**TSLA:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

As usual a gamma monster, hard to read. 750m float shares.

Relevance: Lowish. Not that much gamma compared to float.

Reading: Bullish. Most of the gamma is above current price.

**TLRY:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Huge OI on this one. 136m shares avail. Nearby gamma is something like 50m.

Relevance: High to very high. Maybe 1/3 or shares could turnover in some situations.

Reading: A bit bullish. Kind of in the middle of it all. Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma.

**NIO:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance:  Moderate to ""almost moderate"". It's something like 20% of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases.

Reading: Bullish. Gamma mostly above current price.

&amp;#x200B;

**My relevant positions:**

No positions on most of these.

Short GME on puts.

Long term holder of TSLA shares **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Long BBBY on calls, but didn't do the gamma chart of it here. It's at the bottom of a gamma ramp: **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Tl;dr FAANG Calls,4,l1jn4e,,23,1611179943,"Posted this as a comment but i’ll feed the people. anyone thinking of big braining and sitting out earnings next week or worse, inversing them: don’t. sounds obvious especially after today but y’all re re sometimes and already seeing people posting shit dd. 

&gt;	fb will have record gains for the second quarter in a row. it’s literally no secret faang made a shit ton of money this winter. every fund manager (and the companies themselves) have been saying it for weeks. 

&gt;cathie said just yesterday (for like the 5th time total) that she expects faang earnings next week to be biblical. biggest plays are apple, amazon, and tesla for anyone wondering. of course the others should do well, but these three have been showing every indication (fundamentals, analysts, and fund activity) to put up monster returns.

&gt;“but tesla can’t possibly put up huge numbers” yes very true. but for them the point is crushing YoY which they will. even further, elon is up to last quarters tricks by pumping delivery and sales near the deadline. always the showman i wouldn’t be surprised if plaid and that leaked battery tech get announced, though that’s my own speculation, haven’t read any analysts who are optimistic about that bit. 

&gt;dunno how long it took you to write this but reading any analyst view on fb this week would’ve told you it’s a go. the ios updates haven’t even hit servers yet so no clue why you think it’ll affect next week’s earnings. fb is already prepping and adjusting. plus all users have to do is say allow fb to track. isn’t it interesting that fb is updating ig and messenger? i wonder if they’ll give users stipulations in order use the new features 🤔 (hint hint).

These MITT yearly calls are absurd and just a good buy in general.,2,l1jkb2,,12,1611179706,"Yes, I know MITT is in a bit of trouble. However, they’ve been sitting quietly down 80% because of COVID, and besides a single day at about 7$, have stayed in that range. This stock ranges from 3 to 4 dollars a share consistently right now, with only waiting on a single bit of good news to get its recovery going. Yes it’s a mortgage trust company, but before COVID hit, it was consistently a household stock at 18$ a share. Do you know what the calls are going for? I just bought 10 calls at fucking 0.70 **For January 21 2022** at a strike price of 3.00.

The stock is sitting at **2 fucking 95** l. These assholes are betting 70 bucks that a stock won’t increase 30% **in a full year** when one piece of good news or hype could potentially list this shit at 8 fucking dollars like nothing. Fuck, I just convinced myself to go buy another 5 calls at open. This company is admittedly not the best. But are you seriously telling me this stock won’t ever reach 3.70 when it was listed at 18 dollars less than a year ago? MITT is not going bankrupt, for fucks sake. The stock was at 3.50 LAST MONTH.

A detailed breakdown of the GME Shitron video with answers.,1,l29u6e,,55,1611269258,"SOME of what he said was technically accurate...but those things can be countered with little effort.

1. There is no short squeeze and shares are cheap to borrow!

Really?  Then why is there still negative float?  Why the bombardment of negative media coverage, including your tweet timed just as momentum was trending towards the $50 mark Tuesday? Why the flood of brand new user accounts on financial social media sites relentlessly bashing the stock? And a borrow rate of 30%? Doesn't seem very fucking cheap to me.

2. Numbers don't lie, people lie.

Yes fuck taco, you've lied many times to create a panic scenario in order to make money off of put options...thank you for pointing that out.  I'm sure the SEC will be bending you over eventually this year....AGAIN.

Sales being down for console launch was a result of two primary things: bot purchases sucking inventory availability, and the fact that 75% of the malls across the country were at required limited capacities with less average traffic than 20 fucking years ago due to covid.  Hard to sell things out of a store that can't be open.

3. Valuation matters.  

Yes it does.  All future projected earnings were based off of the EXISTING antiquated business model.  It is fairly clear at this point after Cohen's letter to the board in November that the company will no longer be following this business model AT ALL. While we don't have the particulars of the plan yet, we do know that Cohen, his COO, CFO, CMO built an e-commerce from scratch with a little over 100 million funding and turned it in to a business  that within four years had a 20x revenue multiple and made Jeff fucking Bezos back down from competing aggressively against it.

4. Know who's on the other side of the trade.

Here he implies that all the people buying the stock are dipshits that deliver his fat ass Pizza, while the douchebags running Melvin Capital are the smartest guys around.  What he fails to acknowledge is that individually we might be dumb as rocks, collectively we have unending resources for due diligence, and by now have clearly laid out the underlying true value potential far better then the hedgies who's due diligence has amounted to ""short into oblivion cuz it's Blockbuster 2.0, end of story."" not acknowledging the fact that there's greater odds they've just been complacent thinking that no one would notice they over leveraged themselves on what they just assumed was a sure bet.  He also implies that Ryan Cohen would just take the money and run as if this was a fucking swing trade for him.  It's not only an insult to his intent and vision, but it's an insult to our faith in his character.

5. Your company can become your biggest enemy ie. an offering to raise cash and dilute stock value.

You think we give a fuck if they throw out an at the market shelf offer when this hits $300 after we bankrupt fuckers like you?  The diamond hands in this legion are not going to get salty if they lose a quarter or half of their profits after being up 500%.  It is something that they should actually do...but if they've paid attention at all to what's going on (how could they not?) they know that we're on the precipice of a uncontrollable skyrocket of share price that they can take advantage of.  You think they're going to settle for $40? Think again dipshit.  SIDE NOTE: please don't buy at 300 okay retards?

Deep technical analysis of you guessed it GME,1,l29qc5,,14,1611268930,"Hey guys so I noticed GME wasn’t getting as much attention on the subas I think it should do here are my two cents:
Gme is at 42.60 right now. Because of the concept of rounding, I think this should go up to at least 43 because that is a prettier number. But 43 is also not a super pretty number, as it is odd and I think also a prime number, so it should go to at least 44. But 44 is half of 88, and in Germany the number 88 is associated with a certain mustachioed man in the 40’s  (something about H being the eight letter of the alphabet? Idk I can’t read) so pretty much we have to throw out 44, which leaves us with 45. But remember the concept of rounding I brought up earlier? We round 45 to 50 because I said so, and then 50 to a 100 because of the Rounding Principle again. Thanks.
You can apply this to pretty much any company by the way, if you get confused just ask me or don’t, I don’t really care.",2021-01-21 17:42:10

Short Squeeze Sends GameStop Shares to 2007 Levels. What Happens Next. -- Barrons.comBY CONNOR SMITH | DOW JONES &amp; COMPANY, INC. - 3:42 PM ET
GameStop (GME) stock rocketed above its 2007 peak Friday in a move that one short selling expert thinks could possibly kill investor interest in shorting the videogame retailer. Surging volatility also led to brief halts in trading.
Pointing to an earlier squeeze where a moderate amount of older short sellers covered their positions as the stock surged in recent weeks, S3 Partners' Ihor Dusaniwsky told Barron's he thinks today's action has piled up mark-to-market losses for even newer short sellers betting on a price decline.
He thinks that will, ""force both older and newer shorts to reconsider their conviction in this trade -- more than likely, the short trades will be killed off with no chance to respawn.""
Shares of GameStop (GME) surged as high as $72.88 Friday -- the stock's highest intraday level on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data, before falling closer to $62 around 3 p.m. The stock's last record close, at $63.30, was Christmas Eve in 2007, when Santa Claus crammed his sleigh with Nintendo Wii consoles.
GameStop (GME) added $1.1 billion in market capitalization on Friday, greater than the value of the entire company on Dec. 21, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. With the stock sitting at about $60, Dusaniwsky said short sellers were down an estimated $2.96 billion in 2021, net-of-financing mark-to-market losses, including $1.22 billion in the 40% intraday jump.
""Brokers have been searching for stock to meet the existing short demand but are coming up empty as virtually all the lendable shares have already been taken down on the street,"" Dusaniwsky told Barron's.
Retail investors on social media sites like Reddit's ""WallStreetBets"" forum have been touting the stock for months, betting Chewy co-founder and 13% stakeholder Ryan Cohen can transform the declining retailer into a major e-commerce player. The company said earlier this month that Cohen and two other former Chewy executives will join its board, prompting nosebleed pops for the stock amid sky-high short interest.
Aside from celebrating the stock's burst and urging other users to hold on to shares, some members of the forum mocked Citron Research's Andrew Left, a notable activist short seller who recently took aim at GameStop (GME) stock.
On Thursday, Left posted a YouTube video outlining the reasons he believes the stock will soon fall back to $20. He also disclosed that he was betting against the stock.
Left's argument covered some of the points made in Barron's earlier this month. That article was published when the stock traded around $18. Our timing was terrible, but these gains came in the absence of any real signs of such a turnaround. In fact, holiday sales results, reported on Jan. 11, were worse than some analysts had anticipated.
Since he posted the video, Left told Barron's that his Twitter account has been flooded with users reporting his posts and attempting to guess his password, effectively locking his account. On a backup Twitter account, Left posted a statement where he said the group's actions went beyond name-calling and hacking attempts and included ""serious crimes such as harassment of minor children.""
""We are investors who put safety and family first and when we believe this has been compromised, it is our duty to walk away from a stock,"" Left added.
The onus is now on Cohen and company to deliver the kind of transformation investors are pointing toward. Turning a mall-based retailer into an e-commerce giant is no small task, even for someone like Cohen who has expertise in competing with Amazon.com (AMZN) in the pet supply business.
Without an unprecedented shift, the future looks grim for the bricks-and-mortar videogame retailer. The gaming industry continues to move toward games being downloaded directly on consoles and free-to-play titles that are cutting out GameStop's (GME) core business model almost entirely.

Understanding Blackberry (Limited knowledge of soccer required),1,l2z1x4,,91,1611355481,"
 
Blackberry is like that glorious team that won everything in the past and then got beaten so bad that it disappeared into the oblivion.. They had to face the reality, they got relegated so bad  into lower leagues.. for years now they have been playing the most boring football with 6-3-1 Diego Simeone park the bus formation. 

Recently the owner and the manager have been following the news and seeing all their old mates killing it and breaking records here and there.. They decided its now the time to wake up from the Alberta hibernation they have been in and play beautiful football again. 
 
First Step: They got rid of all the has-beens and the deadwood in the team.. shipped them all on a permanent deal to Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.
 
 
Now who is going to be the scorer? Who is going to be MVP? 
 
So this sad miserable team for years have always had this wonder kid.. A Neymar, Who they played as Center Back in their park the bus ultra conservative game plan.
 
Here is how it happened. 
 
Most car electronics like AC control or Engine oil sensors notifications are done through a software.. this software processes the inputs through an ECU. Most cars have a single function ECU. It’s 8 Bit or 16 Bit ECU that can’t process much.  
 
QNX is way more advanced. They have domain ECU, it can process several functions at the same time. It’s a processor and a computer that is capable of a lot of stuff but It’s just sitting there inside your car showing you your tire alignment.
This is exactly like having an iphone 12 pro and using it as a calculator. Or having Neymar in your team as a Center Back. 

Why didn’t Blackberry develop it to be do more stuff all these years?

Because they wanted it to be safe. Blackberry wanted QNX to be known as the safe reliable solution. It’s that safe system that wont distract the driver, or lock him inside by mistake, or get hacked. It’s a boomer strategy. They never had issues or malfunctions and they always deliver on time. Clients didn’t ask for a better solution, so Blackberry never revolutionized it.
 
They now see Tesla dashboard capable of doing all these fun and profitable stuff.. They decided to join the party. They are going to use the full capacity of QNX. 

Neymar is going to play upfront. Will get all the support and all the freedom to perform in a big league with the big boys. 

Even when Jeff Bizos heard that they are finally going to play that wonder kid upfront and he came to pose and take a picture with him and invited him to play a charity game at Amazon. 
 
Amazon deal with Blackberry is just Amazon trying to be in the picture. They want to associated with Blackberry in any capacity. They are the cloud host of the data that Blackberry is going gather from the vehicles with the new QNX and make it available online for whoever is going to need it. Its nothing and probably wont be profitable. It’s publicity.. A charity game. 



1. First car that will have the new QNX will launch in 2023. (Fact)

2. I think car makers expect Tesla are going to have QNX. QNX has always delivered on time and its safe and cant be hacked.

3. 19 car makers have had a joint venture today. The big names of the joint venture like Jeep already using QNX. I expect the rest are going to follow.

4. The fees car makers pay are going to doubled. (Fact)

5. The new system will allow to host third party apps with subscriptions.. like app store and android. (Fact)

I think its fair to say that Blackberry is going to be a $ 100 Bn company.. it’s imminent. 

They will now have a Tesla run.. they will have a Fiverr kind of run or Cloudflare.",2021-01-22 17:44:41

$FUBO Short Squeeze,1,l2yzep,,2,1611355270,,2021-01-22 17:41:10
Melvin did this to himself 💎🤲💎🤲💎🤲💎🤲💎🤲,1,l2yzd8,,1,1611355266,"As Melvin retires to an overpriced bottle of Japanese scotch, he asks himself how he got here.  How is he staring down the barrel of a gun held by a bunch of internet degenerates who sleep in their mothers' basements and live off of they money they make filming their wives getting plowed by their boyfriends?  All of his boomer spreadsheets and TPS reports told him that GME is screwed.  How did it all go so wrong?

Melvin did this to himself.

&gt; With no fiduciary constraint on share lending, corporate elections can have surprising results. Most notably, in June of 2020, a proxy fight at GameStop surprised the investor and corporate community when activists with only 7.3 percent of shares won board seats despite opposition from large institutional investors that collectively owned around 40 percent of shares. This was possible because nearly 40 percent of GameStop shares (nearly all the shares held by institutions) were on loan, most of which were presumably borrowed by short sellers and other investors with goals contrary to the funds and similar long-term investors.

Here's the sequence of events:
- Melvin submits an order to borrow GME shares for the short sell
- Vanguard has a shit ton of shares thanks to all the index funds in our wives' boyfriends' 401ks, so they lend the shares to Melvin
- Melvin sells the shares to /u/deepfuckingvalue, so now he has the voting stake in Gamestop instead of Vanguard or Melvin, and the price goes down
- RC sees a value play and buys himself some cheap board seats
- Investor sentiment goes up, driving up the price, and the squeeze is on

Then trolls WSB by doing  provocative 'why GameStop sucks' webinars and claiming fake violence against their cat *boo fucking hoo*. Retards take the bait, stock starts exploding, short sellers take a tiny loss and sell their shorts at $55, and ride out the $50 call to $70, cashout, short stock again and troll WSB again.

I’m going to dumb it down as much as I can, and feel free to correct me. Here is why it is NOT TOO LATE TO GET INTO GME!

A lot of bad bears shorted the stock. However, the stock keeps rising. As the stock rises, they are forced to “close” their positions by buying the stock at market price to reduce their loss. The longer they hold as the stock goes up, the greater their loss. This creates a vicious cycle of the stock going up and up, also called a “squeeze”. 

What we all saw today was a tiny snippet of that. There are still millions of short contracts that haven’t been closed yet, but are coming to that point real soon.

When this happens, GME will shoot up much greater than what we saw today. Most GME holders believe it could easily hit $100 by EOD Monday.

(""H2O Innovation"" or the ""Corporation"") is proud to announce it was awarded the engineering contract on a capital equipment project for the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the US, as well as four new municipal and industrial capital equipment projects. These new contracts, totaling $3.2 M, will bring the Corporation's Water Technologies &amp; Services (""WTS"") sales backlog to $37.1 M.

""Our WTS business has been very active, and their efforts are highlighted by the recent wave of projects we have captured, keeping our WTS backlog very healthy. With our business model, the projects we execute often also lead to opportunities for our other business units down the line"", stated Frederic Dugre, President and Chief Executive Officer of H2O Innovation.

The Corporation has secured the engineering contract to design two identical reverse osmosis (""RO"") trains, each rated at 2,200 m/day, for an electric vehicle manufacturing plant located in Texas. Upon successful completion of the engineering work, a purchase order for construction and delivery of the equipment should be issued to the Corporation.

The first project is for an upgrade of the 7,500 m/day Granbury Wastewater South Plant, in Granbury, Texas. The existing conventional activated sludge plant will be converted to a membrane bioreactor (MBR) facility with biological phosphorus removal. The new equipment builds on the plant's current infrastructure, reducing the capital cost, and the upgrade is designed using the Corporation's innovative flexMBR(TM) universal membrane system, which reduces lifecycle cost.

The next project awarded to H2O Innovation is for a redesign and replacement of a failing MBR system at a school in the State of Maryland. The Corporation has been selected to make the necessary repairs and improve the durability of the wastewater system using ceramic membranes.

The third project, an exciting first for H2O Innovation, is the award of a demonstration pilot for its novel SILO technology at an industrial customer in the Midwest US. The SILO platform was developed in-house as a simplified approach to MBR treatment for smaller applications and decentralized treatment facilities where installation costs, ease of operation, and low maintenance are key differentiators.

Finally, H2O Innovation has secured a contract in Southern California for the supply of two RO demonstration units at the Hyperion Water Reclamation facility for long-term testing and public outreach. Each unit will be capable of producing up to 134 m/day treating secondary MBR filtrate. This project reinforces the Corporation's presence and experience in the critical water reuse market.

According to Mr. Dugre, ""We continue to put our efforts into capturing more wastewater, water reuse, and industrial opportunities, characterized by higher gross profit margins, and expanding our presence in Texas, which is a strategic market for us"".

The State of WSB Lately,1,l3mevz,,2,1611441814," 

I'm seeing a lot of manipulation and negativity thinly veiled as good advice here lately. Posts telling people how they 'should' approach a stock, not if, framing GME like some kind of guarantee. When this has happened in the past, people would get called out. Not seeing much of that now.

Haven't seen a single loss porn or 'positions or ban' post in weeks.

The front page is filled with people telling WSB members why they 'shouldn't sell'. Another tells members that considering investing into something else is stupid, and that the diversity of options, if you can call BB and PLTR diverse options, is a bad thing. What the hell is going on here?

Has anyone looked at the other side of what happens in a short squeeze? Are we all assuming none of the bag holders will be WSB members? If your ideas don't stand up to criticism or alternatives, they're not good ideas.

There is a post on the front page attacking the mods for making a GME dedicated thread, as if trying to contain these shit posts is a conspiracy by Citron.

That isn't why mods made that thread. Believe it or not, GME is not the first stock WSB has championed. Tesla, Purple, Zoom, Peleton, MT, or Tanker gang, the list is long, with winners and losers, but always wholesome retardation.

Now it's like one massive echo chamber. The second comment on that post I mentioned was 'I have $1000, how do I buy stocks?'. The third was 'pm me and I'll give you a referral code'.

Mods, contain this growing bullshit.

I don't have any opinion whether you sell your stock or let the winner run. That's entirely upon your judgement and research. 

My point is psychological one. Richard Thaler coined the term house money effect. Put simply, this is the observation that we are more willing to spend and take risks with money we’ve obtained easily or unexpectedly. 

The recent gain of your $GME can feel like unexpected gain, different from your own money (core capital/street money) and you may take more uncalculated risks with this gain. 

Treat your gains as your core capital. Trust me, Money is Money.",2021-01-23 17:28:32

Why Don't GME (and Other) Short-Sellers Hedge with Far OTM Call LEAPS?,1,l3m120,,45,1611440358,"I'm hoping someone more finance savvy than me can explain why short-sellers would *ever* risk unlimited losses when they could essentially turn their position into a limited upside *and* limited downside position by purchasing long-dated calls.  

Obviously their max profit is higher if they don't buy calls.  It's also true that they'd be paying interest to borrow shares on one end, and getting hit with theta decay on the other end.  But if it was me, I'd sleep so much better at night knowing I couldn't lose an unlimited amount of money any given week.

It's hard to tell with all the volume lately, but is it possible that these short-sellers have actually loaded up on calls at some point as a way to eventually exercise to grab shares and cover?  Does this pose any risk to the infinite squeeze if they're already doing so?  Or does it just transform the short squeeze into more of a gamma squeeze?",2021-01-23 17:19:18

Options: A beginners guide (with greeks),1,l49mqd,,9,1611528238,"Alright retards, I've seen a big influx of new members here throwing away money on investments they know next to nothing about. This is meant to be a basic introduction to options prices. I am not a financial professional and this should not be misconstrued as investment advice. 

This will probably be long so **TL;DR:** Stop throwing away your money and learn about what you're buying. If you don't want to read [mike and his whiteboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmQ20J_3K7Q&amp;list=PLPVve34yolHY43YaBegHMzN9WjrTnQfFr&amp;ab_channel=tastytrade) is a good resource (I am not affiliated in any way). 

Initially wrote this at the end but I think it's better at the beginning:
**Practical Applications, General Advice**
-
General pointers for the newbies. Most of the option trading shown on WSB is OTM naked calls or puts with expiration &lt; 3 weeks (*FDs*). **These are like lotto tickets and are not considered responsible investments by anyone, including ourselves. They are retarded and we know it. You should know it too before buying.** Theta is usually insane and probability you make money is slim. On the flip side, selling these options is sometimes considered ok but is often **referred to as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller** due to the low return for high risk. If you want to preserve your hard earned money, make responsible plays. With options that usually means **~3 months minimum expiration, and strikes somewhat least close to the money, if not in the money.** Consider the implications of IV in your trades, and make sure you understand the mechanics of the options before opening spreads. 

-------------

Options Basics

An option is a contract that gives you the option to buy (**call**) or sell (**put**) 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (the **strike price**) at or before a certain date (the **expiration date**). Options are priced **per share**, so a call with a listed price of $1 will cost you $100 total for 1 contract ($1 x 100 shares). For American style options (what most of you are trading) you can exercise at any time before the strike price, while with European options (which are sold for major indices on American markets) can only be exercised on the expiration date. That doesn't matter too much for our purposes but I'll get into that later. 

Options have both intrinsic and extrinsic value. **Intrinsic value** is what that option would be worth at expiration. For example, if you have a $60 call in gamestop, and gamestop stock is at $65, your intrinsic value is $65-$60 = $5 (the difference your strike price vs what price you can sell it on the open market). An option will only have intrinsic value if it is **in the money (ITM)**, which means price is above strike for calls and below strike for puts. **Extrinsic value** is the time value of the option, and will vary based on the **implied volatility (IV)** of the option. The definition of implied volatility is complicated and tends towards circular logic if you apply it practically, but is generally it can be thought of as how much options traders expect the underlying to move. If the stock moves a lot, IV goes up. If there's a big event, like an earnings report, IV goes up. If that earnings report passes, or the stock stabilizes, IV goes down. IV varies greatly depending from one stock to another and can change drastically depending on numerous circumstances, but as a generalization anything &lt; 30% IV could be considered low and anything &gt; 100% IV could be considered high. **Out of the money** options (price below strike for calls and above strike for puts), have value that is entirely extrinsic- for that reason they tend to have larger percent moves than ITM options. 


Greeks 

The greeks can be an intimidating topic but are extremely important if you want to trade spreads (more on this later) and I would argue anyone buying options should have a basic understanding of the greeks. This will be geared towards average/wsb investors, I'm not going to get into the other greeks here because they usually aren't as important for our purposes.

**Delta**: How much the option price will move relative to the share price. Positive for calls and negative for puts. It ranges 0-1, delta of 1 is equivalent to holding 100 shares, delta 0.5 is equivalent of holding 50 shares. Simple enough. This will increase as you are in the money and decrease if you are out of the money. An at the money option will typically have 0.5 delta, a far ITM option will have delta close to 1.

**Theta**: How much time value the option will lose per day. This is &gt;0 (technically &lt;0 if you are short, more on this later). A theta of 0.1 means the value of the option will lose $0.10/share/day, or $10/day. Theta increases as the expiration date becomes closer, so an option expiring this week will lose more money/day than one expiring next month (given same strike). For options of the same expirations, it will typically increase the further OTM an option is and decrease the further ITM the option is.

**Gamma**: Rate of change of delta. This represents how much delta will change as the stock price moves. This is highest for near the money options and lowest for far ITM or far OTM options. 

**Vega**: Change in option price relative to on change in IV. High vega means the price moves a lot with changes in IV. This will increase with the amount of time left on the contract (more time = higher vega) and is typically highest at the money strikes and lowest for far ITM or OTM strikes. 

Buying/Selling Options

Just like stocks you can buy or sell individual contracts, these are known as **naked** positions. A naked long is when you buy the contract, while a naked short is when you sell it. You can also create positions that combine both long and short options, these are known as spreads. Naked positions are fairly easy to understand and trade, though they typically come with higher risk/reward than their spread counterparts. 

**Long vs Short:** You can buy or sell options. Buyers can sell or exercise their contracts to close the position. Buyers need the stock price to move for their position to profit. Shorts can buy to close or wait for the option to expire. They will profit if the price stays the same (from theta) or moves in their favor. Increases in IV will help longs and hurt shorts, decreases in IV will help longs and hurt shorts.

**Naked Calls:** Bulls buy calls. Their maximum loss is the initial cost of the call, their max profit is uncapped. They lose theta. Bears sell calls, their maximum loss is unlimited and their max profit is the initial price of the call. They gain theta.

**Naked Puts:** Bears buy puts. Their max loss is the initial price of their put, their max profit is uncaped, they lose theta. Bulls sell puts, their maximum loss is the strike price of the contract (stock price can't go below zero) minus the initial cost of the contract, their max profit is the initial price of the contract. 

**Spreads:** Combination of a buy and a sell. These come in all different forms and allow all sorts of strategies that are impossible with shares or naked positions. In general there are **credit spreads** which is when you sell the spread and receive money up front, and **debit spreads**, which you buy the spread pay up front. When constructing spreads it's useful to know that the resulting greeks will be the sum of the greeks from all the contracts in the spread. So if you buy a call with delta 0.5 and sell a call with delta 0.25, your overall delta is 0.5-0.25=0.25. I'm only going to cover a few here because I'm getting tired but just know there are a ton of options trading strategies out there.

**Vertical Spread:** Buy and sell different strikes at the same expiration. For example, if I'm bullish on GME I can buy $60 calls and sell $65 calls for 1/29 (debit spread). The cost of the $60 call is offset by the $65, but the profit is capped at $5 per contract. Theta is lower (and can be negative) although delta and gamma are also lower. It's important to note that when the position is ITM, the overall spread price will be less than the intrinsic value of the spread due to the extrinsic value of the short leg (until you're insanely far ITM). For example, that $60-65 vertical spread will be worth &lt;$5 even if GME is $75. The price of the spread will approach its intrinsic value as the remaining time on the contract approaches 0. I can also sell a vertical spread (credit spread), I will receive the difference in value of the two contracts and will need cash collateral to cover the difference between the strikes. For example, I can sell a $65 put and buy a $60 put. Since the $65 put is worth more I receive a credit (lets say $200), then I also need to put up $300 in additional collateral. If GME goes above $65 I can wait for the contract to expire useless or buy it back for cheaper than I sold it. If it goes below $65 my loses are offset by the $200 credit. If it goes below $60 my losses are capped at $300 by my long put (I buy shares at 65, sell at 65) and initial credit received.

**Iron condor:** Combination of two OTM vertical spreads, typically of the same width. Most people trade these short, the nice thing about that is your collateral can be shared between the call and put side, because there is no way for both sides to be ITM at the same time. If you're short you make money if stock price stays the same or if volatility goes down (basically the same). 

**Horizontal spreads:** Buy and sell the same strike at different expirations. AKA calendar spreads. Most useful for betting on changes in volatility. A long calendar spread (sell close expiration buy long) will be long volatility, a short calendar spread (buy close expiration sell long) is short volatility. You can also use this strategy for earnings plays, when you know the short dated options will lose more volatility than long dated options. These are most valuable near the money and will lose value as they go farther ITM or OTM. For this reason some traders will incorporate both OTM puts and calls into these positions. Calls are delta neutral at the money, slightly delta positive OTM, and slightly delta negative ITM (reverse for puts). 


That's all I have the energy for. Feel free to ask questions. Good luck out there.

GME and BB avalanche- What stories are we currently missing out on?,1,l49k9b,,0,1611528028,"I was thinking we could have a thread where we discuss some of the current plays going on that you think WSB is sleeping on. Let’s admit it, we have our blinders on right now.

There’s a few times a month where I scan the market news and see a stock I’ve never heard of up 100%, or a massive multi day run that is somehow completely missed here. For instance, I don’t know a single stock on Stocktwits trending right now, including Tootsy Roll (TR) (wtf). I mean that place is a hell hole and people post lonely pictures of their dog on unrelated tickers but they are decent at being on top of news. We exist in our own bubble which is often a good thing but does tend to screen out other great ideas.

So for a few reasons I think it’s a decent time to have this discussion.

1. A lot of us may have some extra cash on hand for future plays thanks to recent market developments 
2. I have never seen this board so obsessed with so few stocks as GME and BB (with some PLTR and that one guy in the pleated shorts posting on ELY every day) which limits space for others
3. It really is hard to have extra attention, time or money for competing plays with the GME thing going on. It’s all I want to read about too.

But let’s think about some next steps and hear from some competing interesting ideas!

I figured we can use this thread for
- sharing old WSB plays that lost steam when they didn’t return 300% in a week, but are still valid
- new ideas that just have not gotten traction, 
- longer term thesis that may take some time to play out, or 
- other tickers being overlooked.

Once 🔥 I 💰 saw 👁 the story changed, 📈🚼 the 🏻🌎 numbers changed. 😩😩 They ❌😅 were eating 🍴 from 😮 the 🐄🍄 top, 🔼🔼 and 🏽 they ✊ were 👶 eating 👄🍴 from the 😤🚪 bottom. ⬇⬇ And 👏 I 😞 identified the 💬 fact you can't be 🐝 short 👉 this 👈 game. It's 😽 up 🔺☝ I ⌨👈 think 90%. ❌💯 Since then, it's the 👏 opposite when it comes to 💦 GameStop NPD is 🏿🎃 the gold standard when ⏰💤 it 🙂 comes 💦 to gaming reports. On 🔛🔛 January 🕑 14, 👦 they 😅 put out 🏻👌 their analysis of 💡 what December looked like in 🏼⬇ the video ⏸📽 game 🎮 season, 💦💦 hardware sales had their 👈👏 best 🐔 month 📆 ever 😘😃 up 23% year 🙌🏼 over 👏 year, 😘 because 📝 the 😍 two ✌ cycles over 🤔 that time. 🙈 GameStop was 👇 down 9%. Now 🔫 I 🐝😭 understand this 💦🙋 is 👆 what 😌 physical 💏👊 locations, 🌍📍 forget about 🥕 all ✊🌞 the future, 👅 what 😲👏 they're 🗓 going 🏃 to lose to downloading and 🗣👏 streaming ⛵ their 🍆 physical locations. We're 🏾👑 actually down during the past month, 💸 they were losing to 👊➡ Amazon, 💸 Best Buy target, and ➡ Walmart. And the ⏩🚿 reason why 🏫 because people are 👌 not 🚫🚫 going in 👏📥 to exchange their old 💦👴 discs anymore 😷😒 or old 👴👵 games 📀 for new 💦 games. That model 👄👌 has become ♂ dead 😂 and 🔣🌃 antiquated. And 🙅 that was 😟👏 a 🥖👌 cornerstone of 💦☝ GMA. So 😎 with 👯 those numbers that we saw 👁 come 💦💦 out 😬 of NPD it 😽 shows 📺 that 😧 before ⏪❄ they might even try 😐🏃 to turn ❗ the company around 🕦💦 their current 😾🤕 business 💉 is 🙀 just 🙄 drowning. 😰💦 You cannot argue against that. 🏼😠 Number 💳 three, 💁💁 valuations matter. 😡 This is not ❌🙅 Tesla. This is not ♂ a 🅰🎉 company 🏭 that 💦💯 with 🕺♠ a 💰 blue sky, 🏖 this 😤😞 is ☝ a ☝ retailer, you will look 👀 at 🎖🍆 valuations. This is 👏 what no 😻♂ one's 💍 looking 💆 at 🍆 on 😆😛 your Reddit 💰🖕 forums. 💰 So 💯💁 forget 🤔❌ about the 👇 fact 🛡 that analysts have 🈶😣 a consensus $12 target on the stock. ✍💵 Let's just 👌🏼 go look 👀😍 at 😩 Hedgeye and ➕😏 I ⭐👩 like 👍💩 Hedgeye I think 🤔 they 🏻👥 do 😫 great work. 🏢 We're 🤴 fans 🏟 of 📰💦 it. We 👨👦 we 🔨 use that we 🤴👦 speak to 👱 them. ☠❄ They're smart 😭😩 guys, 🏳👨 they 👧 recommended CME when 🕚 it 💁🔫 was 😟 14. 👦 And if 👀🏃 you 👨👈 bought 💲💲 it, 🐐💯 then ➡🔙 you'd be 🅰🅱 making 🏽🚟 money. 🤑 At 👅💰 the time. 👌 It's 💪💯 before 🕰 Jimmy 💩💩 reported their numbers they were 😍 expecting 2021 EBITDA to 🍆 be 👶 around 333 million. 💯💯 Now ❗☝ the ❄😱 street is 😯 at 🤣 71 million. And 👏➕ we we 👥👦 think 😦 they're gonna have 👏 negative 👏👏 even though 🤔 if 🎅🔎 they 🏽 did 🌈🔆 330 million, 😂 which 👏🐱 is 😩💦 seems like 🍑💯 a 👦 completely opposite ↩🔄 number 💦 now. Then 🏿🕛 they 🙎 had 😭 the 🏅 price 💲 target hydride at $26. The 💻👏 model 👄👁 just 👀 does ✊ not 😠 work. And when 💦 you 😫💯 want 🙅 to talk 👄😵 about ⭐ valuations, think 🤤 about 💦🍾 it 😉😩 this way. ☑💫 This 👏🤔 is a 💰😠 retailer. Even 🆗➖ if ❓👏 they fix it, ❗ they're still 😽 a 🏃🍬 retailer trying to ⬆ get ⏳💁 40 times next 👉👉 12 🤐🤓 months, Evie to 🙌📴 EBIT, da 40. Apple 💦 is 23 Best Buy 💵🤔 is seven, Walmart 🤣 is 13. So 🕥🙇 if you like 😄 the 👏 company, 🤔 the 👏📖 fact 📕 that GameStop has ✅ actually 😳 become an 🔞💸 expensive 💵💵 stock 🔧✍ is 💦 just beyond number 🎦 four, know 💭 who's 😂😂 on 💦💰 the 😞💦 other 👪 side ☁🚔 of 🔥 the 💙 trade. 📜 I know 📚💭 who's 😒 on 🌎🏽 GameStop right 👉✔ now, the 👏 people 👨👧 who 🤔😡 are 🙅 ordering pizzas to 💦 my 🙋 house 🏝 or 💦🚫 signing 📝 me 🙊♂ up for Tinder or doing 😉 all 🌞 those 🐐 cute things ☄🏋 trying 😼 to 🅱 hack my Twitter 😩 account. 💳 I 🌷 know you've 👉🤜 been going after a specific hedge fund No need to name 😂 that's 👉 been short 💁 game stuff. People 💋👦 believe 😨🌈 they're 👫🏼 short. 💁⬇ This ❓ particular hedge fund happens to be 🎮 one 😨 of the 🌐🤔 top consumer discretionary funds out 💦 there. 👌👌 So you should actually 😨 listen and ➡👏 see 👁👀 who's 😂👏 short the 👏🏳 name 😐♂ and ➕➕ why 😡❓ they're short 🕛🕛 the name 🎸🤔 as well. Someone 😑 who 💁 does 🏋 go short, I ♂ always 🕔🌱 look 👀👀 who owns 🛂🛂 it. ➡ Ryan Cohen owns 🛂 the stock 🌩 at 🍔💁 $9. ✝ Very 👿👌 smart 🤤 guy. 👨🏻 If Ryan sells it 😡 at 👸🚟 20, 📊🆗 he 👈👏 doubled his 👑🏻 money. 💶 If 🏾🙎 Ryan sells it 🏿💦 at 🍆🤡 zero, 👰 he ☠👉 still has more ➕ money 💸 than 👄 me 👏🏻 and 😲😈 more 🙅 money 💸 than 🏽 you. 👈 So where's 🏿🌎 the stock today? 😍 Who owns it, 📝😭 and 🏻 why ♀ people 👥👨 are 👶🗑 short 🕛🕛 the 🚗😍 stock, ✍ these 🤢🤤 are the 👉 names 📇💁 right ✔ now. And 👏🅱 last ❗ thing 🏼 is 👏 the company can 🔫 become 🤦🏽 your 👉🍆 biggest 🍆 enemy. We're looking at 💦😍 a 💰 company 🤔 with 🙅👏 a 💰👌 billion dollars 💰 in debt. If the 🌽😊 stock ❗💹 goes 🍆 any higher, they 👧 should just sell 💵💵 stock 😅✍ right 💭 into 🅱 you 👈😶 and 👏 raise 🙋🙋 money and 🕰 pay 💰💶 off some debt. More 🍆➕ importantly, if they 💤 want 👏💯 to 👍 make an 💰 acquisition in 🙅👏 the 🤔 gaming space 😫 acquisition start ▶ in 🌍👉 the billions in this place, 🙌🤤 and 🌚☢ they're 👧😈 gonna 👀🔥 have 🈶😝 to 💦 sell 💵💲 a ❌ lot 🤣🍑 of stock ✍❗ to do ⚠👏 that. 🙎 Me personally, I think 💭🚫 you 🏿👉 could 🚫✊ have a ☢💋 pickup. This 👈👶 is 👌🗑 either going to be JC Penney, that brightens in 😌 when Bill 📑 Ackman brought in 🙍 Ron Johnson, people 💁👨 got excited, he was 👥👏 going to turn 🏼 it, 🗻 but ❌🍑 you just 🕛 can't 💦 change 🔀🔁 a 🍒 bad 😞 retailer. Or it 🤔💪 can ✈ be 👏😡 Blockbuster Video that never adapted the 🌑㊙ technology. You got 🎁 to look 🕊 at Ryan Cohen's letter, which is well 😦 written two months ✌🏽 ago to 🔎😣 GameStop management, how 😡🤔 they 👴👨 completely 🙌 dropped 〽〽 the ⏩👉 ball ⚽ with 🏢 what they were 👪 doing. 😛 It's the 🔫 same management right 💩 now. ⏰🍑 The 💰 stock 🌩🌩 was $20, 🎊🆗 before 🍑 we 👨 saw 👀👁 any ♀🍵 holiday data, 📊 there's no ⛔🙅 reason 🏻 it 😂😞 doesn't go 🏃 right 👍👌 back 🗣👉 to 💦 $20. There's 🆗😍 nothing 🔫🙅 in ⚓👏 place there. 😍😍 You can get ❤🎁 mad, 😤😡 you 👈😨 can 🔫🔫 hack my account, you can 💦💦 go to Twitter, 🐦 you 🔥 can 🔫 sign 💦 on, 🔛 you ☝ can call 📞 me 😤 every name. If 👏 you 👈👈 want 😋 to 🗣 take 😡 the company, 🤵 take 🐣👏 your 👈 energy, 😈😈 go 🏃 out there 😍💦 and actually 🤔🤔 buy 💵 something from ⛔ GameStop because that's the only 🔑 thing 💋💋 that says 💭🗨 this.

$BB is the next $SHOP? Looks like it. DD,1,l49f16,,0,1611527591,"1. $BB is now software company

2. John S. Chen, the CEO, is the former CEO of Sybase, a software company acquired by SAP for $5.8B in 2010

3. $BB has entered two rapidly growing industries: cyber-security and IOT (both software driven)

4. Outside of $TSLA, auto manufacturer’s in North America do not have the capability to securely deploy updates to their electric vehicles. $BB QNX platform is secure and can solve this exact pain point (cyber-security)

5. IVY, $BB IOT software can do a slew of remarkable things, namely provide EV auto makers a consistent and secure way to read, normalize, and share data. This is a big deal, and AWS has a great article on it if you need more. Oh, and IVY can also use this data to predict faults in manufacturing equipment and increase automation/efficiencies in factories in the future (auto and otherwise)

6. QNX is currently operating in 175M EVs worldwide and have well established brand awareness in the auto industry (think AWS partnership)

7. Compared to its competitors in cyber security, such as Crowdstrike it’s trading at a massive value. It’s Cybersecurity business alone could help Blackberry experience strong growth.
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? $BB seems to tick all the boxes of a company about to enter 🚀hyper growth mode🚀               
                                  
1. $BB has a strategic software solution that deals with two of customers’ most pressing needs
a. Cyber security
b. Secure software for electric vehicles

2. $BB has been analyzing the market and picking up treasure troves of valuable data through the current vehicles their solutions support (175M)

3. $BB has two solutions that are in demand and both are in a hyper growth industry (think $TSLA, $CRWD)

4. They’ve partnered up with AWS, and at a valuation north of $1.5T, AWS is not look to get into a small industry with minimal growth prospects.

5. John Chen, or should I call him the $BB King Daddy, is well poised and ready to take us all on a trip to the Moon 🚀🧨

If you need additional leverage use margin or take out a personal loan. The interest rates on cash advances for credit lines are &gt;20%, where as interest rates on margin and personal loans hover at or below 10%. Now it could work out for y’all and you could make a ton of money sure. But this type of financial behavior is compounding risk to the fullest extent.

EV Battery winner,1,l4zsel,,0,1611614989,"MNXXF is the best play on the next gen batteries from TSLA and QS  


If production of the battery with 33% manganese content in its cathode is two to three years away, that means there is some time to increase manganese production from the United States and Canada from zero to something above zero.  


Manganese X owns the Battery Hill Project in New Brunswick, from which it has demonstrated an ability to produce high grade battery material yielding manganese sulphate with a purity exceeding 99.95%. A member of the company's Board of Directors commented on its potential and progress as an early-stage exploration project. That member was Roger Dahn, who is the brother of Jeff Dahn who is Head of TSLA's battery research. He stated:  


Elon Musk indicated the future requirements of manganese for Tesla by revamping the battery chemistry of the cathode to being 1/3 manganese and 2/3 nickel. Our Battery Hill manganese property has the potential to help satisfy Tesla’s needs. We’re excited to be commencing our drill program as previously announced (News Release dated September 15th 2020) later this week. Upon completion of the program, work will be initiated for the planned preliminary economic assessment (PEA) study for the project.  
As the project is in the exploration phase, it remains to be seen how much manganese it can supply in two to three years. But at least it should be able to supply something, which would be better than nothing. To my knowledge, this is the most advanced stage manganese project on North American soil that boasts grades that are sufficient for batteries. Plus the connection between the brothers doesn't hurt.

I am from the Netherlands and I have a veryy interesting dutch stock I investigated. It is called beterbed. In the past the holding had a tough time keeping its head up due to the daughter firm. However, the firm itself had a stable revenue of 300-400 mln euro’s. 

No wonder Joel greenblatt elected beterbed as best investing oppurtunity of 2021. Looking at the graph it has u huge upside potential to double or even triple in the long term.

Some quick math on Melvin's position,1,l4zq1f,,0,1611614802,"I'm probably retarded and completely wrong here, but I wanted to see how much exposure Melvin has to GME. 

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wbyx/melvin_is_bleeding_in_the_billions_position_100/) says Melvin had $12.5 billion at the beginning of the year and have lost 30% as of last friday, or $3.75 billion. 

Let's say about half of that loss can be attributed to GME, round it up to $2 billion. If they shorted starting at $15, and we closed at $65 last friday, then they lost $50/share (not including interest). $2,000,000,000 / $50 = 40 million shares.

That would mean if they were to completely exit their position, they would have to buy back nearly the entire float! 

Of course there are probably some mistakes in my assumptions, but this gives you an idea of how much Melvin alone would need to buy back in order to exit their position.",2021-01-25 17:46:42

WSB vs the World,1,l5hgbv,,0,1611678364,"So lately there’s been a lot of discussion about WSB vs the powers that be. Let’s pretend anyone gives a fuck about you for half a second and go over some of the retarded theories you autists continually ruin the comment section with

1. Involving the SEC to stop WSB. Won’t happen. WSB isn’t doing anything illegal. It’s disproven every time somebody posts it. Take 30 seconds to google why this or any other other publisher, media outlet, etc isn’t illegal. Further regulation that fucks WSB isn’t going to happen take that shit to r/conspiracy and stop wasting your precious few thoughts

2. Bots invading WSB. Man I didn’t realize how truly dumb this sub was until I read all the bot comments the past couple of days when anyone dare speak about ANYTHING except for GME. Again take that shit to r/conspiracy. This sub is literally ass right now because of you 3 share holding dumb fucks. Your 1 contract isn’t going to bankrupt you because one person makes a DD post on something besides GME SHUT THE FUCK UP

What WOULD happen if anyone REALLY gave a fuck is an investment into Reddit would be made contingent on this sub being shut down.

Might be a rough ride on Friday,1,l5hg3m,,0,1611678343,"First off, you all are amazing. I love all this energy and everyone making real money. Fun to watch.

I have no idea if you guys are ultimately going to the moon with this and I wish you all the best. I know you all are holding shares but it might be worth a glance at the weeklies expiring Friday. If things stay flat-ish the rest of the week, there is a large number of calls that are going to expire out of the money at or above, say, $90.  Open interest on the put side is maybe a tenth of that. 

Remember that when someone buys a call option they have left the MM in a short position on the underlying stock. The MM wants to be neutral so they will hedge the option by buying stock. Therefore all these options are very likely linked to large long positions in the stock. 

Near the end of the week as these options get close to expiration, the market makers will start to unwind the hedges, which means a lot of shares may sell Thursday and Friday (kind of the opposite of what happened last week, but not exactly.)  By my count it may be as many as 5m shares or so (offsetting the puts that will similarly unwind.) 

So what does that mean? By my read if the price doesn't move up pretty significantly today or tomorrow then I think there's going to be a lot of downward pressure to end the week. 

Do with that what you will!

BlackBerry has potential for a large gamma squeeze this Friday 🚀,1,l5hezf,,145,1611678254,"First off, I am actual retard with a terrible trading history, and some form of mental disability.

TLDR; Mass BB call option buying has forced the big boys to short this like crazy. 🚀🚀🚀

I wanted to point out that whats happening this week in BlackBerry is actually quite amazing. Yesterday, you beautiful retards bought and opened tens of thousands of option contracts that expire this Friday at $25 in BB. There was also a mass buying of the $20 contracts. What we are seeing today and saw some yesterday is big boys are coming in and shorting this stock like crazy. These guys sold thousands of contracts to us for this Friday and they HAVE to keep the BB price under $25 or this is GME all over again.

This is actually the type of setup a large hedge fund might see and say hey if we can push BB over 25 by Friday it will cause so much frenetic buying that the stock might hit 40. 

Likely nothing will come of this, but if you are wondering why your favorite meme play is down today despite good news (BAIDU partnership) and LOTS of new money coming in on the buy side this is why.

Wall street wants to call what we the people are doing ""unnatural."" They rage in the media about how awful we are. They are afraid of this ability we have to participate in the market. They fear that we can have a slice of the pie. They fear losing control of OUR financial destinies. 

My supervisor says they will try to have day trading banned. If they do, this country will be fast tracked into becoming a true oligarchy. Let the SEC investigate. What can they do, tell us this isn't a capitalist society anymore, just because capitalism can also work against the wealthy?

Purchasing $200 of stock is not going to change my life, make me rich, or pay off all my loans. I am not scheming or lying behind closed doors or on chat rooms to become wealthy.

You heard it. 0 losses 7 wins. This will be last big one before taking a break.

What if I told you there was a company almost delisted from the NASDAQ because the company hasn’t been able to maintain the 1 dollar share price to stay compliant.

That's right, sounds like a perfect situation for Melvin type of fucks to short the hell out of it.

However after releasing plans to refocus its business on e-commerce and expand its digital storefront the shares shot up maintaining its compliance.

All shorts have to cover eventually.

Just look at the market cap of this company. This is nothing like GME. NAK(D) wil 10x-50x by itself without the hype of wsb. Now imagine if this gets picked-up by all the new and old members.

With or without this sub, this final stock-pick will make sure I am settled for life.

To my fellow autists: this sub has grown over 30% in the last week and our profits are higher than ever. We should salute our hard work because the chumps on Wall Street know us by name.,35,l6gqai,,3,1611787800,"I want to say that I’m proud of us. Not like your dick manager that takes credit for all the work you put in proud or the condescending parents that were never proud of your achievements, but like the manager that holds your dick for you while you piss kind of proud or that uncle that was always way to drunk at the family reunion and told everyones secrets kind of proud.

We have come a long way in the past year both metaphorically and physically. We have grown together. We have lost together. We have won together. 

I just read a post that because of us, because of you, a fellow autist of ours was able to pay for his family member’s medical bills. THAT IS FUCKING NUTS.

We have turned people into millionaires, Elon Musk into the richest man, and even squeezed the hell out of wall street gang members.

So yes. I’m proud to be a fellow autist. Here’s to another year of fucking over the gay bears #bullgangforever.

Wall Street Bets was like father to me. Rip,49,l6gq8r,,14,1611787796,"Im not a true WSB og but found this sub 2 years ago when there were around 600k subs.   Back then everyone was showing loss porn.  You were expected to bully the person if it was less than $100k.  I could get 50 karma easy for making a joke about jerking off to your tears while your wife fucked her boyfriend.  u/analfarmer2 yoloed 10k into 600k and then lost it all over the course of a month.    There was the GUH moment when we discovered the Robin Hood infinite money glitch.   

I was hooked. 

I don't want to get to sentimental but I know that after  this week, this sub will never be the same.

Thank you to everyone for changing the world and the stock market today.

[Serious] Question regarding GME: Doesn't a 138% short mean that you can literally name your price on Friday?,15,l6gq66,,26,1611787790,"In other words, if Melvin &amp; others have to buy back shares on Friday, but they need to buy back 138% of the shares that are available, doesn't that mean that you literally have the opportunity to sell for whatever price you set? 

I'm thinking this probably won't be the case on Friday because the actual number of shares they have to buy back is only a fraction of the 138% total shares that are shorted. Do we know exactly what percent of the total short positions are expiring on Friday? If it's more than 100% of the float, does that mean we can literally name any price we want for our shares?

Does this make any sense or am I completely retarded?",2021-01-27 17:49:50
